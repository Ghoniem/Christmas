    "Adam is 18 and is a freshman at the University of California at Santa Barbara .  He is staying in a dorm that overlooks the Pacific Ocean.  If you have been reading these letters over the years, you will recall that Nasr spent a sabbatical in Santa Barbara.  The view, according to Adam, hasn't changed.  The beaches are still filled with bikini-clad bodies and muscled surfers in wet suits.  Yes, Adam is really studying.  He is studying to be an Electrical Engineer.  (I think there is an echo from a previous child, and a little pressure from Dad.)  If you recall, in my last letter I spoke of the Adam's dreaded disease--senior-itis.  If I gave you the impression that the disease was bad in December, let me tell you, by June is was ALMOST incurable.  I received a phone call two days before graduation that Adam may not graduate because he didn't like to attend art class! (Of course, Nasr was in Washington D.C at the time.)  I don't know who suffered more from the disease, Mom or Adam.  It turned out that he made the number of classes that he is allowed to miss by only one!  He did graduate and now he is doing very well in Santa Barbara.  All the words of encouragement that we gave him finally sunk in.  Or maybe it was someone who has more influence on him told him he could get straight A's.  He's on his way to getting them.  He got a 100% and a 90% on two chemistry midterms.  He finds chemistry easy.  Now he realizes that school is really not that hard if you open a book, read it and listen to the professors lecture.  (Isn't that an amazing concept?) Adam is doing so well in chemistry that he decided to work on his own chemistry project.  He and a friend were hungry for brownies.  It was a seven hour process that included a one hour hike to the store, 10 extra eggs, a mixing bowl that was actually a zip lock bag that could handle excessive squishing, and microwave baking because no real oven could be found.   Adam's chemistry experiment yielded brownies that were burned in the center, because the microwave bakes inside out.  But, they were the best brownies he ever tasted.\n",

    " Nasr has been to Europe three times in four months, a little bit of Madrid, Prague, Paris and Copenhagen with an excursion or two to Egypt. While visiting Egypt, he discovered Trianon.  It is a Danish bakery established in the 1600’s that recently opened a café just blocks from our home in Alexandria, Egypt.  So this time, Nasr “worked” at the bakery while overlooking the Mediterranean, drinking cappuccinos and eating tasty pastries.  How many people want his job? On one of our joint trips, we stopped for lunch at an airport, and for the first time Nasr was asked for his identification—just to make sure he was old enough to imbibe. He is closer to the big six and yet, this was the first for him.  He looked dumbfounded and it took him a while to realize the waitress was serious. But I think it went to his head because now he spends more time in front of the mirror believing his spot is shrinking.  It’s November and all the new electronic toys have come out and Nasr, as usual, bought the newest toys for himself.  This year he purchased a computer phone.  It is about 3” by 5” and it holds all his contacts, calendar, email, PhD presentations, international presentations—oh, and it also is a phone.  Make Nasr happy and call him on his new toy.  He keeps it turned on all the time, not like previous phones.   818 825-0244.  \r\n",
    "     Virginia did Sweden!  This year I accompanied Nasr to one of his conferences. (He tries to tell me that conferences are boring.  He’s lying!  They are lots of fun—especially a dinner cruise on a Danish fiord.) While he was actually working during the day, I met Helen Singh and Jean Bacon and we had a Spouses Spectacular Spontaneous Swedish Spree.  The swift ferry ride, the scenic countryside, the immaculately groomed gardens and the gourmet dishes of the fishing villages was capped on the ride home, by the spectacular view from the bridge that overlooks Denmark.  Nasr has never been to Sweden.  Of course, I won’t name all the countries that he has visited that I haven’t—but I have Sweden.  This year I learned that there is one job that is hazardous to my health.  I was washing dishes and  just as I was  reaching to put the clean dishes in the drainer, my back suddenly cramped.  I couldn’t move for days! (Of course, Nasr was on one of his trips.)  It wouldn’t let up so it required many trips to the chiropractor.  Moral of this story—if you don’t want to hurt yourself, don’t do dishes.  Somehow this year Nasr has gotten into the season very early and has purchased my gifts before Christmas.  He has redone our bedroom and for the first time in 30 years, I have a NEW bedroom set.  OOOOH, it is very pretty and very luxurious.  He also bought “me” a new Plasma TV.  If you think that he bought the TV for me, then the diamond that I’m buying next week is for Nasr. (Don’t tell Nasr, it is a secret.)   Besides, do presents that arrive before Christmas day count as Christmas presents?  \r\n",

    "   Amira (soon to be 26) and Matthew celebrated their first wedding anniversary this September.  One of the benefits of married life is that Amira has become a very accomplished cook.  Almost all of her recipes are from Martha Stewart.  She is addicted to watching the food channel. At least Matt doesn’t have to listen to tales about mom’s cooking, only Martha’s cooking.  They are very active and athletic. (This is why Amira can make these great meals and they both stay so slim.) They run, swim, bicycle and one of their favorite sports is hiking. When Nasr travels these two, very kindly, make sure that I am not alone or lonely.  One Sunday afternoon, they decided they would take me on a hike in Will Roger’s State Park. When we first drove in we saw a lively game of Polo with fast moving horses and flying mallets.  I figured this had to be high class hiking—so nothing too strenuous.  This will be an easy afternoon.  Amira knows that I do not like heights, so she “prepared” me for this hike by showing me the bridge that traversed a canyon that we were going to cross.  I was going to be tough—if I didn’t like it, I could close my eyes and they could lead me across. (Yes, I trust them that much.) Surprisingly, the bridge was a piece of cake to cross.  The unbelievably steep, downhill, limb filled, deeply eroded, foliage covered path was strenuous.  Getting lost eight or nine times, sliding down the bank on my derrière, passing animal skeletons hanging on some old ruins,  swinging Tarzan style on the hanging vines, and traipsing through ankle deep creek water all while “following” Amira and Matthew, the experienced hikers, was exhausting, demanding, laborious and backbreaking.  Amira stayed brave for me.  I stayed brave because it is very embarrassing losing your cool in front of your son-in-law and somehow (hallelujah) we made it out.  Now that Nasr is back, they are talking about taking us both hiking.  Do you think we should go, or just stick to the Polo games?  Amira and Matthew are taking a long vacation (3 months) so they can travel and see the U.S. before they start their new jobs in Washington D.C.  I can talk about it now because they are still only 30 miles away.  It will be a different story when they are 3000 miles away.  But, I will behave like Scarlet O’Hara and I will think about that tomorrow.  I am sure you will hear about it in my next letter. (Look for tears on the paper\n",
    "    Adam at 23 is a Marine fighting in Fallouja, Iraq. We don’t get to hear from him very often, but we write a lot of letters.  It has been over two weeks since we’ve heard from him.  I am hoping once the elections are over that things will calm down a bit.  He did learn some Iraqi Arabic and is using it to communicate with the people there.  The part he likes about being there is giving the educational gifts and toys to the kids.  He says the kids are really sweet. Earlier this year, when he was in between jobs because of the uncertainty of going to war, he called me at work to say hello.  Not two minutes later, my cell phone rang and Jazz was on the line.  I was trying to talk to both at the same time. Since neither of them wanted to wait, they both popped the question simultaneously of why they had called.  “Mom, do you have any money?”  Both phones. Both children. Same question.  When you are out of funds, just call the Bank of MOM.  (Yes, I was a sucker and they both got money.)   Adam called several weeks ago with a  good story from Iraq.  He said this was something to put in the Christmas letter.  It gets very cold at night and he and another Marine (both from Los Angeles) had checkpoint duty.  The heater went out and it was really cold.  They do not have coats to wear over their uniforms so they have to find creative ways to stay warm.  Adam said he and his fellow Marine used pieces of an old shack to start a fire.  He used his Boy Scout training to start a fire with no matches.  He didn’t elaborate, but I think he used methods that Boy Scouts don’t use.  The most important part of the story—he warmed up on a very cold nigh\n",
    "     Jasmine at 19 is attending the local university and trying to decide what she wants to do with her life.    At the present, she is living in a house with three other girls.  Since she cannot afford to be out of touch with anyone she was devastated when her cell phone was stolen.  At considerable cost to Mom, (learn from my mistakes, get cell phone insurance—it is much cheaper), I managed to get her phone replaced.  Now, with a new phone you must put the right message on the phone.  It was a simple message, but it had to be perfect.  She paced as she created the message.  While in the bathroom, the message sounded too angry. So she moved to her room to try it.  No,  it didn’t sound right.  Finally, while sitting in her closet behind a closed door, she voiced her message over and over and over until she got it just right—the right words, the right tone, the right feeling.   Can you imagine what her papers would look like if she put that much effort into making them sound just right?   To keep her company in the house of 4 girls and many visitors, Jazz decided that she needed to get a kitty.  So, she brought home a black cat from the animal shelter and named it “Chicken.”   She has her reasons, but I keep begging her to change the name—she won’t.  I am sure my dad is sorely disappointed in me.    He raised me on a farm and now my daughter doesn’t even know a cat from a chicken.   Now, Jasmine got the cat to keep her company.  However, as there are a lot of people at her house, she was worried about the cat and brought her over here so we could watch her for a couple of days.  Well, the cat, has been here for a month and every time I suggest that Jazz take her home, she kisses me and says, but don’t you like the cat, mom?  Now, I am a grandmother of a cat named “Chicken” who sits on my shoulder like a parrot while I walk around the house cleanin\n",

    "Nasr had a year of great highs and great lows.  Unfortunately, two days into the year, Nasr lost his mother.  This was a horrible way to begin the year, but his parents have been watching over him to make sure his year turned out great. They really had to watch over him carefully when he was remodeling the house.  Sometimes my dear sweet husband is penny wise and pound foolish. As part of fixing up the house, he needed to trim the trees hanging over the gazebo and in various other parts of the yard.  In his “wisdom” he purchased a chain saw. (Now to most Americans, just the thought of a chain saw fills them with horror.) When Nasr told Adam he was planning to use the chain saw and save 1500 dollars, Adam begged me to convince his dad not to go ahead with his plan.  (Remember, Adam was in Iraq, worried about his father—rather than worrying about the dangers there.) Nasr decided to use the saw himself rather than have the YOUNG and STRONG workers use it. Yes, thanks to their watchfulness, he safely trimmed the 10 trees in the yard.  However, no parent saves their children from danger without a little punishment for their actions.  Therefore, Nasr ended up with such severe shoulder pain from the trimming that the $1500 he saved on not hiring someone to trim, he paid to the chiropractor to alleviate the pain! Nasr has earned the title “Distinguished” Professor at UCLA.  Yes, it is a great title, but as with most great titles, no money is attached.  He was also elected as a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  This is a great honor! (You’re right—no money!) After 8 years of hard labor and collaboration with Daniel Walgraef, Nasr completed two books. (1 book 2 volumes and 1100 pages.) Everyone thinks Nasr is the quiet one, but he’s the wordy one in this very lengthy masterpiece.  Now I challenge all our friends to go out purchase this book and try to make sense of it, or perhaps you can use it for weight lifting, because it won’t be a light read!  \r\n",

    "Virginia’s year was filled with worry for Adam.  Pray you never have to send your child off to war.  The dye no longer covers my grey because worry totally changed my hair color. (If you think I was bad, Nasr was worse—at least now he has an excuse for his hair loss.) While Adam was away there were not many times to have fun, but I did attend a conference at Universal Studios and I had the chance to walk the RED CARPET.  Yes, I do have pictures and yes it is everything I dreamed it would be.  You feel so special when you walk on the red carpet and hear them  clapping. (Of course it was the Universal employee paid to clap, but, she was clapping with gusto.) This is the first year Nasr and I have actually discussed the “R” word.  At first retirement was something that I feared, now I LOOK FORWARD TO IT!!!  If we play our cards right we can retire when I’m….(Oops,….when I’m seven years older than I am now.)  As soon as Adam was home safely, Nasr and I relaxed and traveled the world. So, I ate paella on my birthday in July in Madrid.  We spent a month traveling in Madrid, Cordoba, Sevilla, Prague, Alexandria, Marsa Matrouh and Cairo.  I swam in the most spectacularly warm Mediterranean waters. Yes, me the hydrophobic swam in the deep water for hours on end. The good news is that salty water makes you more buoyant and some people are naturally more buoyant than others (I’m not telling you why) so I was floating happy.  Now, when I’m in the sun, I always generously slather sunscreen all over my body.  However, I didn’t have it on my lips when I enjoyed 6 or 7 hours in the sparkling, turquoise water.  Within minutes of dragging myself out of the refreshing sea, my lips began to swell and blister.  As I was looking for some sympathy from my husband, he turned and said I should be happy about my very large and sore lips.  He said people pay big money to get collagen in their lips and now my lips were huge for free.  (Do you think he is focusing on saving money because all his “promotions” bring no money?) We decided to travel this winter as well. We used Nasr’s GPS system to get us into the Wisconsin rural wilderness.  The signs inside the hotel rooms warned us against walking the trails because the pheasant hunters might mistake Nasr’s plume of hair for a pheasant.  I have a thing for water this year.  In summer I swim in it and in the winter, I throw it.  My siblings and I managed to change a beautiful pristine snow-covered garden (first blizzard of the year) into a battlefield of freezing snowballs. We had loads of fun, but I forgot my gloves and now my hands are aching with arthritis and pain.  If Nasr tells me the rich and famous put their hands in ice cold snow to shrink the wrinkles, I may send him on an errand through the pheasant filled hiking trails.  Later that same evening, my siblings and I danced and caroused on the dance floor at my niece’s wedding. We all used to wonder why our nieces and nephews were afraid to get married.  I finally realized that it isn’t marriage that they are afraid of, they fear the behavior of their aunts and uncles at weddings. \r\n",

    "Amira and Matthew left Los Angeles.  Amira is now working for the state department and for some silly reason she had to move to Washington D.C. to work for the federal government.  I took it quite well.  I only cried for the first 6 months after they told us they were leaving.  By the time they left, they only had to drag me for a few miles as I hung onto the door handle because I couldn’t let go. (Only kidding about the few miles—maybe it was longer.)  Why is it that we encourage our children to do great things and then when they do them they always have to do these great things FAR AWAY from us.  (Don’t remind me that I did it to my mother, because now I know what I did to my parents.  Why do we have to find out the hard way?) Matthew merely moved his office from LA to DC and continues to work for the Aerospace Corporation.  (I tried to convince him to stay too, but Amira had more convincing power than his mother-in- law.) While they were still in LA they took us to Huntington Gardens.  As usual we stopped at the gift shop and they found a book with Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet in it.  As they perused the pages, they decided they would read it to each other.  (Now, to you romantically challenged individuals, that is an extremely romantic thing to do. Hint!) They have a lovely house with a basement and a guest room for visitors.  (Yes, I’ve used it and plan to use it again during the holidays.)  Working for the state department gives Amira the opportunity to hear Heads of State speak.  Well, the back of the head of President Bush was the only thing she saw when he came to speak to her department. Unfortunately, she wasn’t home for the Thanksgiving holiday because her work sent her to Vienna for 5 weeks. I think Amira got the travel bug from her dad. Is there something in the Ghoniem genes that they need to travel and see when the world and use the excuse that they are “WORKING?”  Matthew very intelligently spent two weeks with Amira in Europe.  At first I was worried that Amira would not have a Thanksgiving dinner because they do not celebrate that particular holiday in Austria.  However, Amira, along with several other people, had Thanksgiving dinner at the US Embassy in Vienna. The Ambassador served them dinner on plates embossed with the Presidential Seal. Don’t you feel sorry for her missing Thanksgiving at her moms? \r\n",

    "Adam is home from Iraq safe and sound. (Or as sound as any Ghoniem can be.)  He arrived in April on a rainy morning.  The rain disguised the happy homecoming tears of everyone there.  When Adam got off the bus he was in uniform with his M-16 slung across his left shoulder and his machine gun slung across his right shoulder. I didn’t see the knives and Kevlar but I know they were there when I hugged him.  When he was in Iraq, he had three calendars in his room. He marked off each day three times and then checked the calendar at least four more times during the day as he waited for the day he could come HOME.  After many sleepless days and nights of traveling under cover of night, very sudden takeoffs and quick landings, breathing jet fuel while camped on the runway waiting for his flight out and the excitement of coming home, he was exhausted. It was strange to hug your expertly armed son, but there was so much pride at that unit for all the Marines, and so much relief that these men had come home. Adam doesn’t want to say much about life in Iraq and we may be curious, but we will wait until he is ready to tell us.  Adam stayed at home for a few months and is now living in an apartment and going to school studying electrical engineering.  He is now guarding and checking the points he has on his exams instead of guarding the checkpoints in Fallouja. Nasr feels his son is a genius in higher level math.  He has gone from a Marine to a Mathematician, both require skill, concentration and both will make the world a better and safer place.\r\n",

    "Jasmine is awesome—at least that is her description of herself.  And to tell you the truth, I have to agree.  She has decided she wants to be a nurse.  She is taking some very heavy duty biology and psychology courses and (KNOCK  ON WOOD) is doing wonderfully in them.  She likes her classes and she is going to class every day.  When she has an exam she writes on multi-colored note cards and studies from the three inch high stack of notes!  This is a very different Jasmine than the one who used to live here.  So, if anyone sees the old Jasmine, tell her we have the new and improved version at home and we are keeping her. Jazz is exercising up a storm.  She pulls me out the door once a day, then she walks with her friends, and finally she jogs with the dog.  When Jasmine decides to do something, she does it.  My hips, knees and other assorted joints may not like it, but Jasmine is not listening to their complaints and is making us get in shape. One afternoon we were exercising to some very fast music, well I had to grab my upper body to prevent it from making a scene, but Jasmine was too late to grab her pants as they fell to the floor.  I guess all this exercising is paying off if her clothes are falling off!  Jasmine has only taken a few classes toward her degree, but she is already diagnosing me.  I have to say I’m a little concerned especially when she says that because I forget some words, sometimes forget what I was going to do, and sometimes don’t end my sentences, she thinks I have Alzheimer’s.  Now, for all of you who forget some things occasionally, what kind of diagnosis will she make for you?  Jasmine’s cat, “Chicken” keeps me company at night when we are watching T.V., well at least when I’m watching TV.  Nasr is usually snoring on the other couch and the cat is most often snoring in my ear.  I’m afraid to tell Jasmine because she will say I’m going to go deaf from the noise, but then again she’ll say it won’t matter because I won’t be able to remember what it was like to hear.  \r\n",

    "Nasr—continues to travel the world.  In just a few days he will be leaving for Nice, France. He complains of being tired, but traveling to France in the middle of a Revolution might rejuvenate him. Nasr is humble and he doesn’t want to talk about the awards and prizes that he has earned over the years. (Believe me, he has quite a few.)  But when he went to Egypt and visited his cousins in the Ghoniem Village, they were extremely disappointed in him.  The neighboring village has a son of a son of a son who has earned the Nobel Prize.  Nasr’s cousins in the village cannot understand why Nasr has not gotten the Nobel Prize.  They think he’s not working hard enough and that he needs to bring honor to their village—the Egyptian version of keeping up with the Joneses—and he needs to very soon get himself a Nobel prize so the village can brag about their son of a son of a son of a gun.  Well, Nasr may not have the Nobel prize, but he certainly has the prize winning ability to bargain.  Once the lease on my car ended, Nasr suggested I drive his Mercedes (great idea for me) and he would drive Adam’s 1999 Civic that had a little run in with another car.  It was drivable, but the door was pretty smashed.  On one of his trips to the hardware store a fast talking, New York accented, young man convinced Nasr that he could fix the dent while Nasr was shopping. It would only cost him 300 dollars.  Now, we all know that is a steal—but remember the adage, you get what you pay for. Nasr agreed. Believe it or not, he still has the car, but it does look a little different.  Nasr came out 20 minutes later and he saw the dent was removed but there were at least 10 bullet-sized holes scattered across the side of the blood-red car.  Nasr gasped, argued, ranted and raved.  He paid the two guys 20 dollars  each and left in a huff.  Now he drives a car that looks like he had a run-in with one of Bonnie and Clyde’s machine guns.  The car can barely get up the mountain to get him to UCLA.  He scurries to get into the slow lanes so he doesn’t get run over. Then once at UCLA, he ducks his head as he enters the parking lot and prays no one sees him.  If anyone has any influence over this man, please convince him that he needs to buy a new car.  We even have space for a new car because Nasr built a shed for all our “stuff” to be stored.  His shed, or as I call it, his “Shedteau” is this beautiful two story barn-shaped building in the backyard.  Most of the stuff is stored in the loft so he made the first floor a “Command Center.”   He has his computers, books, and everything one needs to run a command center.  He spends hours down there. At least he answers his cell phone when I call him for dinner.  He would like to invite all his friends to spend a beautiful day, enjoying the garden while sitting inside his “Shedteau.”  I, however, would like our friends to spend time in our lovely, large HOUSE. \r\n",

    "Virginia—had the chance to travel this summer.  (Ok, so I travel most summers, but this was a wonderful summer.)   I do not know why it has taken so long to get to Italy.  But if you have never traveled overseas, you need to visit Italy.  The history, culture, and romanticism are things everyone must encounter. My favorite city is Sienna.  It is an old medieval town whose architecture hasn’t changed since the 1400’s. Walking hand in hand with the man you love is a special treat, but another is overlooking the green and gold Tuscan countryside.  This sight has been enjoyed by thousands over hundreds of years and it is breathtaking to be part of the hordes that savored the beauty. Nasr, not known for his overt romanticism, really hit the mark on this trip. Not only did we enjoy Italy, but he took me to Paris.  On a busy street corner in the heart of Paris, we shared a chocolate-filled crepe under an umbrella, on a warm summer night, cuddling close to escape the light rain.  I know I saw lots of sights, but that was the moment I will always remember. I can hear my children eeewwwing and cringing.  This is not something they wish to imagine, but to those in my generation, romance at 60 is still possible.  We also walked the Downs in Kent, England—more romance.\r\n",

    "Amira and Matthew are still living in the Washington D. C. area.  And they love it!  (Darn—I thought the cold weather would have sent Amira packing and coming back to Los Angeles.)  She did have some concerns with the cold, however.  Amira washes her hair and then drives to work with her hair still wet.  The day of the first freeze however did give her some cause for concern.  She was not worried about driving on icy streets, she was worried that her wet hair would freeze, break and then fall off.  To her happiness, she is not walking around with short little curls on her head.  Matthew and Amira have jobs that are exciting and fulfilling.  She and Matthew love to run and hike.  They’ve seen a black bear on their hikes and Amira has run over 100 miles in a month.  (How long would it take her to run home to Mom?) They live in a 50’s vintage home and there are some unwanted creatures who love to venture into warm spots.  Being the Knight in Shining Armor that Matthew is, he set some mousetraps before he went off to fight the good fight in the far off land of Florida. (Translation—he had to travel for work.)  Before Amira went to work, she went down to the laundry room and she spotted a mouse in the mousetrap.  She was in too much of a hurry to remove it then, so she waited until after work.  Now, on the way home she was mulling over in her mind the myriad of ways to remove a mouse from a trap. (That is the job of the Knight and she had never done it before.)  As she pulled open the laundry room door, she gasped.  The mouse and trap were gone.  This is good news and bad news. Choosing to focus on the good news that she didn’t have to touch a dead mouse, she bent to take clothes out of the dryer.  Suddenly, something rubbed up against her foot.  EEEEEEK.  Yes, it was the mouse AND the trap.  Both ran. Amira pounded up the steps and the poor mouse went pitter patter thunk slap, pitter patter thunk slap as it dragged the trap behind it.  Amira, remembering that she is an engineer, grabbed the ancient tool to remove mice, a broom.  She chased the mouse with the broom with little success.  Finally, she devised a larger trap.  She opened a large paper bag and in one quick sweep swished the mouse and trap into the bag.  She now hopes that the mouse will escape the bag after it gets to the dump.  May I give a mother-in-laws suggestion to the Knight—don’t set traps when you are going off to fight the good fight.  For their 3rd anniversary, they traveled to Italy.  They couldn’t resist after mom and dad bespoke of Italy’s virtues for days on end when we visited their lovely city of Falls Church.\r\n",

    "Adam—is now a proud homeowner.  He has purchased a two bedroom condominium with a loft and a balcony in Canyon Country.  Now he has to furnish it from the ground up.  He is lucky that he has a father who is very generous and who likes to fix things.  Adam will be in for a rude awakening when he realizes how much upkeep a home entails.  I will let you know next year how well he is handling his new acquisition. Acquiring things is what my children do quite well.  Considering that Adam is moving into a large spacious area he figured he would be clamoring around by himself in this two bedroom condo so he decided he needed a companion.  Adam is a muscular, six-foot two-inch, Marine who is studying the boxing art of Muay Thai.  So you can imagine the type of dog that Adam would bring into his home.  Well, you wouldn’t be right.  He has purchased a Toy Fox Terrier. This little bouncing, big eared, long-legged, four pound circus creature barely comes up to Adam’s ankles.  Don’t ask me how this minimal dog got the name of Maximus (Max). He is great fun with which to cuddle and play.  Adam’s greatest challenge is potty training.  Do not say my children are fools.  He is potty training his puppy at my house so when he finally moves into his white carpeted home, all the accidents will be over.  Also, I find myself babysitting for a crying puppy when his dad is out.   Adam is continuing to take his electrical engineering classes.  We are hoping that they will not be interrupted again, but his Marine Unit is scheduled to go back to Iraq this coming November.  If there ever was a time to wish for peace on earth, this is the time.  \r\n",

    "Jasmine (Jazz)--cannot hide her glee that Adam is moving out and she will be the center of attention and she will get the biggest room in the house. (We offered her two small ones, but she wouldn’t take them.) Now, mom has two rooms and she happily has plans for them.  But she will have to get a lock on them so they do not become dumping grounds for any excess junk that Jazz doesn’t want in her room.  Jazz is taking tough chemistry courses and doing well. Of course, she does have two tutors at her beck and call.  (Nasr and I wonder how old we will be when WE can actually get out of college and STOP STUDYING.) If any of our friends miss the old college rah-rah, the stresses of exams, and the long, tedious, hours of studying, just give a call and we’ll gladly step aside and let you take over.  We lost two cats this year (Lucy lived to 17) , so Jazz couldn’t stand the fact that we only had one cat, (named Chicken—and she is) in the house.  To our surprise, only a couple of days after the appearance of Max, Jasmine brought Lola home.  Lola arrived feeling pretty sickly  and our daughter has been practicing her nursing skills on this little, grey and white, scruffy kitty.  Nasr’s expression was not one of pure happiness.  He feels that the animals are pushing him out of his home. (He may have a point there.) There was a lot of grumbling, mumbling, arguing and then cooing and ooing when he finally saw the darling little Lola.

    "As usual our year has been filled with fun, fruitful and sometimes frightening times, but, we have come out unscathed and ready to reminisce on the year and to tell yet another story.  Now, with computer in hand (ok, on my lap) and Christmas music echoing through my earphones, I’m ready to tell the tale of the Ghoniem family.\n",

    "Nasr cannot deny his age or even hide it anymore.  In October, friends and former students staged a symposium in honor of his 60th birthday in Tallahassee, Florida.  Nasr was supremely honored by the number of people who attended and many flew in from across the globe. Even after all these years, he still insists that attending a conference is work, but whenever I go, there is a lot of laughter, scrumptious meals and wonderful, stimulating, conversation with great friends.  If this is what you do at work, I want your job. Speaking of work, Nasr, unfortunately, did “work” while we were on our summer vacation.  However, teaching has now taken on a different look.  He taught an online class which required hours of advanced preparation including sitting in front of the camera at UCLA and presenting 40 hours of lecture.  Now, fast forward to our summer vacation and picture yourself on the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt.   Imagine turquoise and royal blue waters lapping over beautiful red reefs and in an about those reefs are fish of purple, yellow, green, and blue hues.  Each creature, both large and small, has unique patterns of stripes and spots. (They assured me that there are no sharks in this area—I didn’t see any sharks, but we were snorkeling in the middle of deep water with no land in sight.) The sound of the water lapping against the reefs is so peaceful; yet watching the wildlife is exhilarating, particularly if you are watching for sharks.  Now, as soon as Nasr finished his snorkeling and was sitting on the yacht with nothing to do but watch fish jump from the rippling  sea he pulled out his trusty iphone because he was working!   No one really knows the power of these little gadgets until you are in the middle of the Red Sea.  You expect to feel the gentle rocking of the boat, the powerful warmth of the sun beating down on you, but you don’t expect you will have the power of the Internet.  While I’m gazing across the blue expanse, Nasr is emailing his students from his class and answering their questions.  He is teaching and providing the support they need from his “classroom”.    Now, with his iphone, Nasr’s classroom can be anywhere—on a yacht in the middle of the Red Sea, or in a gondola on the narrow waterways in Venice.  But I must admit technology did not help us in all cases, particularly when the hot Santa Ana winds blew over California and ignited the mountains and hills behind our house into a fiery inferno.  I must admit our hearts pounded in fear when we were awakened at 4 a.m. by police sirens and the tinny sound of the police officer shouting through the loud speaker, “Mandatory Evacuations!  You must evacuate your house immediately.”  What do you take?  The P’s—pets, papers, prescriptions, pictures and people!  The cars were filled with “necessary items”(ok some jewelry is necessary too, even it is doesn’t start with P) and we drove down the street watching our neighbors packing  their cars, all of us not knowing if we were coming back to our homes or not.   What do you do when you are stressed and temporarily homeless?  Well, for Nasr, he goes shopping.  What does he shop for?  He shops for computers—remember “computer” doesn’t start with a “P” so it wasn’t packed.  Ok, I lied. You know Nasr doesn’t go anywhere without a computer, but he took my computer by mistake.  Since we couldn’t get back into the house, he purchased a computer that he can take anywhere.  So, when you see his 6 inch by 9 inch little blue computer, you know he got this during the evacuation.  Remember, when Nasr travels, size does matter.  Thank God, the firefighters performed their daily miracles and we were able to get back into the house later that evening. \n",

    "Virginia has a long, long, long way to go before she is anywhere near Nasr’s age.  I just wanted to make that very clear so no one has any misconceptions.  This year, along with all our other travels, we are re-discovering Los Angeles.  We may not be teenagers anymore, but we love to go bicycling along the beach and enjoy the spectacular ocean view with fiery sunsets and cool breezes. We each listen to our ipods as we bicycle past the hot sand and the breaking, thundering waves.  Our only problem is synchronizing our speed.  We have the same music, but the shuffle mode means that sometimes I’m listening to classical music and rolling at a relaxing speed, while Nasr is listening to the fast-paced, belly dancing, rhythms and it is obvious he is pedaling to keep up with the shimmying hip swings of the dancer.  When he listens to the love ballads of the 70’s and s-l-o-w-l-y reminisces, I’m listening to the 60’s beat of the Beach Boys and my wheels move like I’m riding fast rolling waves.  We bicycle a distance of about 15 miles and are fortunate to travel through the colorful city of Venice, California.  It is here that we must carefully dodge and avoid the city’s  assortment of street entertainers, artists using a variety of media from henna to silverware, and young bikini clad ladies, each more beautiful than the next, skating on fast moving roller blades. I try not to be jealous, but Nasr had a near collision with one of the young ladies, and I am desperately trying to convince myself it was not intentional, it was merely that he was staring at the other more scantily clad girl and didn’t see the one merely wearing short shorts. Nasr blames it on Pavarotti—he says he was focusing on the power of Pavarotti’s voice and his feet were simultaneously powering along and he just didn’t notice the world around him. Now, you know why Nasr is so willing to get his exercise at the beach.  But, the beach is not only for exercise, we do want to relax.  I suggested Nasr take a book to help him relax. However before we go, I do need to check his backpack, because the first time we went he planned to “relax” with a book that teaches C++ , the computer programming language.  I informed him that this book was not recreational, nor relaxing.  Finally, I convinced him to take a magazine to read.  Ok, the front cover of the magazine spoke of economic ruin for the world, but you have to realize that this is relaxing for Nasr.  Not only have we relaxed in Venice, California this year, we also made a sojourn to relax in Venice, Italy.  You must visit the beautiful, narrow, winding streets and canals and enjoy the romance of the city—especially a gondola ride.  Yes, Nasr held my hand lovingly while the gondolier sang in the beautiful black and gold gondola while we silently floated through the narrow, ancient canals. (My kids are eewwing right now.)    On our way to Egypt this year, we stopped in Venice, Vienna, Salzburg, Bratislava and Budapest. The highlight of Austria for me was the high winding mountain ride to Salzburg. For four hours one way we listened to Mozart and enjoyed one spectacular mountain view after another. (Nasr decided he never wants to hear Mozart again after listening to 8 hours of non-stop Mozart.)  Ok, we took a rather circuitous route on our way to Egypt, but if you are going to travel, never travel in a straight line.\n",

    "Amira and Matthew are living in Falls Church, Virginia and love it.  I was hoping that the cold weather would scare Amira and bring her back home, but she is tougher than the icy weather.  Actually, it is her job with the opportunity to travel that keeps her in the area.  Amira is definitely following in her father’s footsteps.  Just like her dad, she has done a lot of traveling this year.  Her travels have included a couple of trips to Israel and a trip to London, Australia and New Deli, India.   She is two up on her father because Nasr has never been to Israel or India.  She tells us tales of the beautiful white marble Taj Mahal with its colorful history of intrigue, love, and betrayal.  The streets of India are a maze of cars, bicycles, “took-tooks,” huge semi-trucks, pedestrians and cows!  She is amazed how anyone can actually get to their destination, but she assured us they all do.  She was particularly astonished by a row of cows that stood perpendicular across traffic. Somehow, the cows crossed the street unharmed and then patiently  stood in front of different vegetable vendors and restaurants waiting for the owners to feed them before moving to the next door.   Of course, she didn’t leave Matthew behind all the time.  Together they went to Nice, France.  Warm weather, the blue Mediterranean and the one you love.  It couldn’t have been better—well, maybe a little longer, but not better.  Creativity is still Matthew’s middle name, so while working and attaining a great promotion; he also created a beautiful sculpture for his parent’s garden.\n",

    "Adam started the year off sparkling-well at least he started by giving Oanh a sparkling diamond.  So, at the stroke of midnight, he and Oanh were officially engaged.  (His father needs to look at the rock and learn—I’m proud that Adam knows how to pick out a beautiful stone.  Remember, a mother’s pride is different than a father’s.)  Adam is now a home owner and has learned the trials and tribulations of dealing with a broken garage door opener,  the washer and dryer gas hook up problems, plumbers, and a mortgage.  He has also found it isn’t all bad; he also gets to enjoy the heated pools and tennis courts.  Nasr and I took Oanh and Adam to the beach with us to enjoy kite flying and swimming in the ocean.  Nasr was really feeling his age and gravity when Adam showed off his muscular physique.  Adam has been working out and his biceps and calf muscles are huge testimonials to how hard he has been training.  Poor Nasr took one look at Adam’s muscles and you could see he was totally deflated (and it was obvious his muscles were too) but Adam convinced Nasr that he would help Nasr get back in shape.  Adam also got the travel bug from his dad.  His travels however are more domestic because he wants to see his great country.  He’s been to New York and Washington D.C.    However, starting in January, the Marines are preparing to send him and his unit of Marine Reserves to Afghanistan.  When he is finished, Adam also will have traveled to two countries that Nasr hasn’t visited, but unfortunately, it hasn’t been by choice.  Once this tour is up—Adam will be finished with the military and he will focus on his future.\n",

    "Jasmine completed her Associate of Science degree and is at this moment filling out applications for nursing schools.  She has applied to 17 schools and we will know by this coming April what school she will be attending.  So obviously she has been studying very hard and our dinner conversations revolve around phrases like “electron capture, beta emission, neutron decay, N over Z, and positron emission.”  Now for the non-nuclear chemistry aficionados, you may feel left out and a bit confused.  Don’t worry; I definitely was not a part of that conversation.  And now I know what it means when they say, it was all Greek to me.  To help prepare for her career, Jasmine has been volunteering at one of the local hospitals.  She can hook up heart monitors, move patients from bed to gurney and back and she proudly makes even the grumpiest patients smile. Jazz has two cats, Mortimer and Chicken.  As everyone knows, with animals, comes the responsibility of cleaning up after them.  However, Jasmine believes that really isn’t a part of her job description.  However, Mom and Dad insist if she wants money, she must clean up after the cats.  One Saturday, when the odor was particularly overwhelming we again demanded she clean it up.  So, as any well prepared nurse, she donned her surgical gloves and lacking a surgical mask, she had to improvise.  She covered her nose with a gauzy, fruity designed paper towel.  She secured it behind her ears and tucked the top under her glasses.  She gingerly picked up the litter box and held it at arm’s length.  She pushed open the garage door with her backside and as she turned around the gardener approached from the yard.  Jasmine, dressed in her Dr. Frankenstein surgery gear, looked at the trash can helplessly, willing it to open up.  The gardener was a complete gentleman and graciously opened the trash can.  Please remind me that I owe him a huge tip for not laughing uproariously at my daughter.  But, believe me, he had a great story to tell when he got home.  Jasmine will be a great nurse, and I wish I had a picture of her in her litter cleaning gear to put next to her nursing diploma.\n",

    "This historic year has come to an end, but history is still in the making.  So many good things have happened and will continue to happen. Pray Adam comes back safely—or maybe even better—pray for a Christmas miracle or a January 20th miracle and that things will change and he will not go.  I will not let myself feel down and sad about the world. As you can see, the world shouted for joy in November and it is this pure joy and happiness that I wish for everyone.  Have a Happy and Healthy New Year.\n"

    "Nasr had a very busy year. It started out with a gold embossed invitation to President Barack Obama’s inauguration.  Yes, we have that one framed.  No, we did not go because it there would be too many people and it was way, way, way, too cold.  Nasr is very proud of his warrior son. While Adam was training at Camp Pendleton, someone took a picture of him in full body armor holding his M16 at the ready with his ammunition draped over his shoulder.  Adam looks quite intimidating in this photo.  To Nasr, it is a treasure that he wants to flaunt.  Therefore, Nasr took this picture and made it into a huge poster.  Once he got the picture home he proudly carried it to the living room and wanted to put it over our door.  It took a lot of sweet talking, but I finally convinced Nasr that the photo of the modern, tough Marine did not really fit well with our white, ornate, Victorian furniture and the French tapestries.   However, it was perched in the front bay window for a few weeks.  (I think he really wanted to intimidate any would-be burglars—and show off his pride in his son.)  Now, thank goodness, it resides proudly above Nasr’s office door.  I really wonder what his UCLA students are thinking.  It is my guess that they know they better study and  get good grades—or else!  Nasr loves to do projects around the house.  Well, since we’ve been in our house for over 22 years, we sort have run out of projects to do here.  But….Amira and Matthew bought a new house this summer.  Oh, my goodness, Nasr was in seventh heaven.  This was the perfect opportunity to help his children AND to work on house projects.  Virginia (that is the state in which Amira and Matthew reside) has an abundance of beautiful green trees.   It is my guess that there must be 100 trees for every person in Virginia—maybe more.  In their new yard tree branches hung ominously over the house and the bushes and flower beds were grossly over grown.  Nasr was salivating at the chance to help.  So, he hired a crew of tree trimmers and gardeners and in less than a week their house visibly brightened from the inside and now passersby’s can see that that they have a lovely home.  It was a bit of a nail bitter for Amira and Matt because they were not sure if Nasr was going to tear down every limb and leaf.  But, whew, he stopped in the nick of time and created a beauty.\r\n",

    "Virginia is a grandmother.  Ok, that was painful to write.  Having a grandchild gives you the most rewarding, happy, fulfilling moments that you can imagine.  When you look at your grandchild you see your own children and you feel those same wonderful feelings that you felt when you held your own child.  But, this is even more intense.  The only issue I have is that now I am called Grandma. When I hear that word,  I picture old grey haired ladies wobbling down the street.   I don’t see myself that way.  The scary part is that my mother was my age when she became a grandmother and I thought she was really old.  Now, I realize, my mother was a very young grandmother—just like me.  Even though there are days when I feel as old and achy as Granny, make sure you call me “Teta.”  Also, I intend to be very involved as a grandma.  Now I just have to find a way to live in Washington D.C. or find a way to bring them back to LA.  I know.  Both are almost impossible, but I am asking Nasr for four round trip tickets to D.C.  for Christmas.  (Maybe I will sneak in a few more on my own bank account, too.)  There was another first for me this year.  I know many people see me as a bit of a character—ok my siblings think I’m a little eccentric. (They might say crazy, but I think that is a little harsh.)   But, this year I was actually a character in a play.  California State University, Long Beach wrote and produced a play entitled,  “And the War Came.”  This play was a collection of vignettes—or little stories—of people’s experiences with the war in Iraq.  One of the professors knew that Adam had been in Iraq so they asked to interview me.  It was a powerful play—pretty difficult to watch at times—but it was enlightening to see so many aspects of  the war and how it affected different people.  They even entitled one of the vignettes, “Virginia.” Ok, the character/actor was 25 years younger than me and a “bit” thinner, but she vividly expressed my thoughts and the feelings of many military families.  I really hope that more people could have seen it.\r\n",

    "Amira and Matthew have multiplied and have welcomed their beautiful dark haired, brown eyed ,  rosy, chubby, cheeked, beauty into their home.  Siena Malika Koerner was born on August 12, 2009.   Both Amira and Matthew are great parents.  They have the patience, love and knowledge to take care of their daughter.   These two tried to do it all this year.  They moved into their new home in July and brought Siena home in mid August.  Moving into a home is a huge undertaking without the added burden and worry of a pregnancy.  I have to say we raised a hard working daughter.  She went into work in the morning and went to the hospital that night to deliver.  She is so responsible that she attends an “important” meeting while she is having contractions.  Amira is sleep deprived and wondering how old Siena will be when she sleeps through the night and Amira will be able to sleep peacefully.  I hate to break her bubble, but my children are much older and I still have trouble sleeping peacefully at times.   Gidu (Grandpa) and Teta had a chance to visit Siena—ok, we also visited Amira and Matthew—in  November. Siena had changed so much since we saw her as a newborn.  Siena babbles non-stop. (I have no idea where gets that from.) She and I have great conversations and I haven’t decided if she is going to be a singer or a politician.  I am inclined to think it may be the latter because her double talk doesn’t make a lot of sense.  Matthew is making sure that Siena will be educated in great literature.  While Amira feeds her, Matthew reads Melville’s classic, “Moby Dick.”  He will tell you it is for Amira and himself, but I know he has great plans for his beautiful daughter.  Oh, just to let you know, Gidu is planning on teaching her calculus in a few months.  He figures he needs to start early.  \r\n",

    "Adam is our hero.  He does not consider himself a hero—as most of the Marines believe.  These young men put their lives on the line every day so we can enjoy our freedom and our safety.   Until I had a child in the military, I never knew how much military families give to this country.  As I am writing this letter, Adam is returning from Afghanistan.   I must admit he had a chance to see the world. On the way there, he stopped in Ireland, and Romania. The first stop out of Afghanistan is Kurgistan. While he was waiting to leave Kurgistan, he stood in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains gazing at the huge snowcapped peaks. But, his stay in Afghanistan was not a cool stroll in beautiful nature.  He was stationed at a Forward Operating Base in theintense heat of the Helmand Province.  By the time he left, he had built walls and structures for the troops that were relieving him, but his stay was fraught with 130 degree temperatures, sleeping in the open, unsanitary conditions and firing his Howitzer daily.  Marines live with absolute terror mixed with unbelievable boredom. He did appreciate the small computer we sent that was filled with movies. (No, there was no internet and he could only use a satellite phone every few weeks.)   Of course he has not been able to tell us what it was like, other than they lived in what looked and felt like moon dust.  Every item they used or received was covered in dust.  They lived on MRE bars—yes tasteless bars that give you necessary nutrients, but no flavor.  He was living in these conditions for 7 months.  If all goes as expected, Adam will be home tomorrow—yes there were several delays and he will be finishing his engineering degree and he will be forever finished with the deployment.  We have been babysitting Adam’s dog, Max. (We really would like a real grandchild—I just thought I would let Adam know.) Max is a Toy Fox Terrier.  He stands about  8 inches tall so you realize that he looks at most people’s ankles.  So, toes and feet are very accessible for him.  I know it is a dream of many of you that you would have so much adoration from someone that they kiss your feet.  Let me tell you.  Max loves to kiss and lick feet and toes.  It tickles and it is almost impossible to escape from Max’s determination.  Next time you wish someone will kiss your feet, just let me know and I’ll send Max and you will definitely change your mind.\r\n",

    "Jasmine has made the big move out of the house.  She was accepted to University of California, San Diego.  Her major is human biology and at this point is planning on going to medical school. (Anyone want to lend some poor parents some tuition money?) Jasmine is now living with two other young ladies.  There are words coming out of Jazz’s mouth that I never thought would happen.  She cannot believe that her roommates are so messy.  She complains that she has to clean up after them.  Why can’t they keep the kitchen clean? She wonders.  Nasr and I don’t know if we should laugh or cry because she would never have thought of cleaning up after herself when she lived at home. She is learning how to cook, too.  I wonder why she never had the urge to learn at home?  Oh, Jazz has to take very high level calculus.  She didn’t have much of a background in it, so her father spends many an evening with her tutoring calculus.  All I can say is thank God for the computer, the camera and Skype.  Nasr went out and got a white board on an easel and focuses the camera on the easel and proceeds to teach her all she needs to know in calculus.  I am telling Nasr that he should go on the internet and make a lot of money tutoring students. (Hey, that might pay for Jasmine’s medical school.   Jasmine took her cat to her apartment.  Her roommate brought her dog for the weekend and somehow, magically,  the cat ended up with fleas.  She gave the cat endless flea bath, complained, more flea medicine, complained loudly to mom and dad and then finally brought the cat home for us to deal with.  No, by now, the fleas are taken care of—thanks to mom and dad.  Being independent is not what many people think it is cracked up to be.  \r\n",
