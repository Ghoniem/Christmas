<h2>December 1986<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1986" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Greetings from the Ghoniems</p>
<p>MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL! “  … I apologize in advance to all the people who hate getting this kind of Christmas letter.  Every Christmas is a
busy time of year, but as of yet, I haven’t adjusted to the changes in our family life.  Give me another 18 years and I should have it down pat.
So, as I was saying, any of you who can’t stand to read this, stop right now and give us a call.  I promise to give you a very personal
rendition of what has been happening to us over the past year.  The number is (818) 891-1616.</p>
<p>Now, for all you die-hards who are willing to put up with this kind of letter, or for those of you who actually enjoy them, I will continue. The
biggest news about the Ghoniems is that we have expanded.  I suffered all through 1986 (not too silently either, just ask Nasr) in order that we
could have our third and LAST child. (Yes, you may quote me on that).  Jasmine Suzanne Ghoniem was born on August 29, 1986 at 11:46p.m. She came
into the world at night and that is the time of day she loves best.   She weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces at birth, and now has topped the scales at
over 13 pounds.  She is growing fast and takes after her mother, she doesn’t suffer in silence. I think Jasmine may be our only blue eyed baby,
finally one of the kids took something from Mom.</p>
<p>Adam is four years old and is not adjusting very well to having a baby sister.  He spends the majority of the day trying to twist his hand
around her head as if he were trying to juice it like an orange. To say the least, Adam and I are having quite a few arguments over the proper
way to touch the baby, and I’m losing all of them.  Adam started pre-school this year and goes three days a week.  He enjoys it and it gives him
some socialization with other children, and besides all those good things, it gives Jasmine’s head a rest.</p>
<p>Amira is six, about to be seven, but going on thirty.  She is doing very well in first grade.  She has been accepted into the gifted program.
Now all these talents come from someone, and depending on whether you ask Nasr or me, will determine whether you hear it comes from my side of
the family or his.  But since I’m writing this letter, it comes from the Schink side of the family.  Amira is an excellent baby-sitter.  Once
she finishes her homework, I simply drop Jasmine into her lap and then proceed to do everything I should have done during the day in
approximately one hour.</p>
<p>Virginia, still young enough to admit she’s only a mere 32.  Look, what do I have to worry about, I’m the fifth out of six.  It’s my siblings
that cringe when I give my age because everyone knows they’re lots older than me.  (How many of you think I’m going to get four very nasty
letters from my siblings? At least that’s one way to get them to write to me.)  To say the least, I’ve been very busy with the three kids.  I
spend the majority of my day chauffeuring kids to and from school, settling fights, helping with homework, nursing and changing babies.  My
writing is sort of by the wayside until Jasmine is a little older and I’m more organized.  We are in the process of remodelling the house, and I
must admit, IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!  We made the mistake of having a child at the same time as we remodelled.  Learn from someone who knows,
either have a child or remodel, don’t do both!</p>
<p>Nasr, who will really be 39 in January , and I’m sure he’ll stay that age forever, has also had a busy year.    He’s had several opportunities
to move, but found UCLA really is the best for him.  He became a full professor in July and now theoretically, he could sit back on his laurels
and relax, but that’s not in Nasr’s nature.  He has his hands in more pies than ever now and he almost has me convinced that he likes what he’s
doing.  But then again, our trip to Lake Tahoe showed him how good the life of leisure really is.  He faltered a little in the summer, but now
he’s back full swing and working long, hard hours.  Nasr, who loves large families, is definitely convinced that our family is large enough. The
noise level in the house is deafening and most days, he would like to escape to a quiet place (for that matter so would I), but he’s a very good
daddy who spends lots of time with all three kids, and no, he hasn’t forgotten how to change a diaper.</p>
<p>Our year has been filled with joy, happiness, and new beginnings. It is our fondest wish that all of our friends and relatives have a very Merry
Christmas and most of all, a wonderful, Happy New Year!</p>

<section id="december-1987">
<h2>December 1987<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1987" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>SEASONS GREETINGS</p>
<p>Another year has gone by and I must say our lives have been enriched, new horizons have been sighted and my patience has been s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d!
Again, I’m apologizing in advance for a typed letter. I wish I had the time to write a letter this long to everyone, but as there are so many
people I want to share our lives with, it is totally impossible to be completely personal. I’d have to start in July to finish by December, and
then what I’d written in July would be old hat, so I’d have to rewrite, but there’ d be no time so…AAAAAHHHHH…a vicious circle. Therefore
and thusly, you get this. The same holds true this year as last. I promise a personal rendition if you call us at (818) 891-1616.</p>
<p>NASR has had a full, busy year. He has adopted a new schedule. He leaves at 6:30 in the morning and comes home at 7:30 in the evening. He uses
the excuse that the LA traffic has gotten so horrific that if he doesn’t leave early and return late, he’ll spend four hours commuting only 16
miles. You can believe that if you want to, but as you read on, you may come to a different conclusion. Nasr also spent five, lovely,
fun-filled, stimulating yet relaxing weeks in Europe and Egypt. He spent two weeks in the French Alps, hiking and sightseeing. He says he went
there for a workshop. He then spent two weeks relaxing with his family in Egypt, swimming in the Mediterranean, taking walks along the Nile and
enjoying his family’s company. He spent the last week of his trip in southern Germany, meeting old friends, sightseeing in the museums and the
zoo and shopping. Of course, I won’t complain all that much about the shopping as he was shopping for me and the kids. Again, this was a
“conference”. He came back feeling very good about the conference and workshop, and said he gained a lot from them. My question is, however, was
what he gained from it really work related?</p>
<p>VIRGINIA, while Nasr spent his time in Europe spent five, 1-o-n-g, lonely, frustrating, exasperating, and earthshaking (we had two earthquakes
while he was gone) weeks in Los Angeles with three very active children. (That’s too long a story to relate here.) As a family, however, we did
take a wonderful vacation in Wisconsin this summer. I got a chance to see my high school friends at our own personal 15 year reunion. (I
graduated when I was 6). It’s nice to know that time doesn’t change what’s deep inside a person, even though the mirror tells us differently and
our kids nearly bust themselves trying not to laugh at our high school pictures. I also had the honor of organizing the family ancestral photos.
Sounds impressive? Actually, Mom had several boxes filled, helter skelter with pictures of total strangers, or so I thought. These pictures were
of family, grandparents, cousins and friends. Poor Mom, I think she regretted letting me do the job because I wasn’t content with just pasting
them into the book. I wanted to know who all those people were and how they were related to me. I know I taxed her memory and we spent lots of
hours on it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I regret is that I couldn’t find a picture of Daddy as a young man dressed in something
other than overalls. I’m sure such a picture exists and my next crusade is to find a picture of Daddy, with hair and dressed in a suit. When I’m
not vacationing, I’m busy writing. I’m determined that someday I’ll publish a book. So, hang onto this letter. It is an original Virginia
Ghoniem letter and perhaps someday it will be worth something. At least it will help start a fire in your fireplace.</p>
<p>AMIRA, 7, is doing well in third grade. I admit I was a little worried about having her skip second grade, but it hasn’t affected her at all,
and she even was citizen of the month in November. Amira is not content with mere studies. She needs other activities to keep her busy and not
bored. In ballet, she is doing beautifully. She is graceful and elegant, and can move her body in ways that Mom can only dream about doing. She
gave a piano recital at the beginning of November. She played Beethoven’s “Fur Elise” and she did it wonderfully. She was very poised and calm
while playing on the Grand piano. Her one little quirk is that she loves to read while standing on her head and practicing her gymnastics. She
got the love of reading from her mother, but I assure you, that the standing on the head part must have come from Dad.</p>
<p>ADAM,5, is no longer juicing Jasmine’s head, but he has devised new devious ways of irritating her and getting some negative attention. Jasmine
will “accidentally” fall according to Adam. But, mother’s trained eye has seen him stick his foot out and trip the teetering toddler. And of
course, he thinks a simple “I’m sorry” is going to forgive all his sins. He is seriously thinking of making a tape that only says “I’m sorry” on
it. He’ll keep it on all the time so then he won’t have to be bothered with unimportant apologies that have no meaning to him. Yes, he’s smart
and he’s doing very well in kindergarten, too. He wishes he could spend all day in school. (Should I say it? No, you understand.) Adam, in
school, is a wonderfully behaved boy. He got the first Good Citizenship award in his class. Summer vacation at Grandma and Grandpa’s was most
memorable for Adam. He loved helping Grandpa feed the cows in the barnyard. Adam, when he is excited, talks and walks, and doesn’t watch where
he puts his feet. Yes, you’re right. He backed right off the wagon and landed in a pile of manure. Adam popped up sputtering and accusing
Grandpa of pushing him off the wagon, and to this day, Grandpa still can’t stop chuckling long enough to confirm or deny it.</p>
<p>JASMINE is 15 months. I’m reluctant to admit this, but I gave birth to a monkey. No, don’t get me wrong. She is a beautiful little girl with
bright, shining, blue eyes and a head of curly, blonde hair. But somewhere, way, way back, one of her ancestors must have made a wrong turn in
the evolutionary chain. (Of course, I’m not naming names, but we know who grew up on the African continent, don’t we.) Believe me, I’m not
making rash statements, I can back up my claims. I will put Jasmine in the family room and walk into the kitchen. By the time I turn around to
glance at her, she’s standing in the middle of the table reaching for the chandelier, just wishing she was an inch or two taller so she can
swing on it. And, if she’s not on the table, then she’s standing on top of the television or doing a balancing act on the fireplace or running
across the back of the couch. Feeding time is strenuous exercise. She doesn’t sit calmly in her high chair. (Don’t tell me to tie her in because
she can get out of places that would have baffled Houdini!) She’ll sit calmly in the high chair for 30 seconds and then stands up and starts
doing deep knee bends while I’m trying to stuff food into her mouth. She’s a smart monkey, too. As soon as Adam comes near her, she lets out a
warning screech that would rival any of those primates in the zoo. Adam, then walks up to me and says, “I don’t think Jasmine likes me. What do
you think?” Should I lie? 1987 has been filled with a wide variety of happenings and lots of happiness. I can say it now because those antics
are in the past and I thank God I’m not a psychic because I don’t want to know what the kids have in store for me in the future.</p>
<p>We hope all of you have had a great year and we pray that next year will bring you even greater happiness and joy.</p>

<h1>December 1988<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1988" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SEASONS GREETINGS</p>
<p>I can’t believe another year has come and gone. This year has been so busy for us that we’re still a little unsettled. Well, I better say we’re
a lot unsettled. For those of you who haven’t heard, we’ve moved! My hat goes off to those who can sell their house every five years. For me,
AAGHH!!! I’m never going to move again. I’m going to grow roots in this house and you’ll have to dig me out to make me move. We’ve all seen the
commercials about how easy it is to move and how enjoyable an experience it is, well, I have news for you. They lie. I won’t go into the gory
details because I’m not one to write horror stories. The only good part is that it is a horror story with a happy ending-a real rarity these
days. Our new house is big, 5 bedrooms, and we have a half an acre of land. (To some, that may not sound like a lot, but in Los Angeles, that’s
the Ponderosa!) Nasr has a wonderful time walking his estate and a miserable time dealing with the contractors. It will look gorgeous and
everyone will have to come and visit us, but don’t act surprised when you trip over my roots. Our new address is:</p>
<p><strong>11809 Andasol Avenue
Granada Hills,   Ca.   91344
Tel.   (818) 366-4846</strong></p>
<p>NASR had a magical turning point in his life this year. He turned 40! For some 40 may come as a time to regret and fuss, but Nasr really took it
quite well. Even though his back is not that of a twenty year old, he’s still lifting weights every morning and trying desperately to look like
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Like I said, he took 40 quite well. I wonder who’ll he’ll try to look like at 50? He’s been very busy at the university
and swamped with trying to get all the landscaping done. Our half acre lot now is one giant desert (you know, like the Sahara in Egypt). Nasr is
struggling to turn it into an oasis of beauty. I think he’ll succeed, but right now the task seems formidable. Hopefully, in next year’s letter
I’ll be able to tell you how gorgeous it looks.</p>
<p>VIRGINIA looks at 1988 as a year of success. I even succeeded in keeping a New Year’s Resolution. I was resolute to lose 15 pounds. I lost that,
plus 15 more! I think this is the first year in my 29 plus years that I actually kept a New Year’s Resolution. But there is more, since I lost
the weight through Weight Watchers, they hired me to be a meeting leader. Yes, I now am a working mother. No, let me clarify that. I’m a mother
getting paid for working outside the home. Every mother is a working mother, only some of us get paid for it. Now that I’ve lost so much it
seems I have endless energy. Well, not endless, but more. Anyway, on top of being Mom (meaning chief cook, bottle washer, chauffeur, maid and
referee), I’m also going back to school to get my teaching credentials. So I’m a studying, getting paid for my work Mom. My writing. I’m still
writing, but it’s off to the side while I finish my schooling. Teaching is great. I’ll have my summers off and do my writing then. I have it all
planned out. Ask me next year how my plans are going. If I answer in a mumbled, incoherent manner, you’ll know everything is under control.</p>
<p>AMIRA   is   eight,   will   be nine   in   January,   but   I   feel   I   have   a   teenager   in   the house.         Isn’t    the    loud
music,    funny    moods,    strange    fashions    and    over    all weirdness    mixed    in    with    moments    of    concern    and
helpfulness,    all    traits    of    a full fledged teenager? If you tell me its going to get worse I think I’ll cry. I think God should
supply every woman who is contemplating getting pregnant with a yearly breakdown of what to expect from the kids. I don’t mean a watered down
nice version, I mean the real horror story. I know Mom always excused my weirdness as phases to my sisters, but good grief. There’s no way I
could have acted like that, was there Mom? Please tell me I can blame it on someone other than my own genes. Amira is active in ballet and plays
piano beautifully, she’s doing well in school and loves the new neighborhood because it is filled with kids and most of them are her age.</p>
<p>ADAM is a very strong six year old. Yes, he is physically strong, but he is also a very strong willed child. I’m trying to use a nice euphemism
for stubborn, but it just doesn’t truly express how it really is. Adam is doing wonderfully in school. He is reading sixth grade novels from the
library even though he is only in first grade. He was taking piano lessons, but stopped because Mom got tired of “convincing” him to practice.
He does very well in karate. He is a very agile, strong and coordinated child. If he gets much better in karate I will have a hard time
controlling my strong willed child. He and Jasmine tolerate each other. Only occasionally do I see him irritating her. He and Amira now are
competing for some negative attention. They are beating each other, screaming at each other and having a wonderful time doing it. Mom, however,
is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I finally realized why women go back to work when the children get older. No matter how chaotic a job
you undertake, it’s got to be a thousand times easier than being a Mom.</p>
<p>JASMINE, at two, is Nasr’s shadow. From the time Nasr walks in the door, until he goes to sleep Jasmine is with him. The other kids are so busy
with their friends that Nasr felt ignored for a while. But now Jasmine is completely filling his time. She just recently gave up the bottle,so
now we have a major war every evening to get her to sleep. More often than not, I’ll find Jasmine in Nasr’s arms and he’s fast asleep and she’s
busy playing with his mustache and nose. Jasmine is trying to do everything that her big sister does. She saw Amira in her ballet costume, so
she INSISTED that she wear one of Amira’s old tutu’s. Now Jasmine is forever wearing a bright yellow tutu over her winter blue jeans and long
sleeve shirts. She eats, breathes and sleeps in that tutu. All hec will come down if we try to remove it from her body. (And believe me, that
presents a problem when I’m trying to potty train her.) I’m sure she will be a clothes hound when she grows up. Most children love to hold teddy
bears when they sleep, but Jasmine is just a little different.   She wants to hug Amira’s bright, shiny, black patent leather shoes when she
sleeps. I hope a psychiatrist doesn’t read this letter. Who knows what he’d think?</p>
<p>All joking and kidding aside, this year has been a good one for all of us. We spent a wonderful time visiting family in both New Orleans and in
Wisconsin this summer. My parents celebrated their 50th anniversary. Now that is something to work towards. Look, they did it and they had six
kids! Doggone, now I have no excuses for not doing as well. This year we find ourselves in good health and happiness and we hope that this
letter will find all of you healthy and happy.y and happy.</p>
<section id="december-1989">
<h2>December 1989<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1989" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>I’d sing the song and send it on a tape, but my children insist that I have such a screeching voice that everyone would think I was sending out
a Halloween tape. Well, maybe my voice has gotten a little screechy now, but in BC (Before Children) I used to sing in choirs and I’d sing
lovely lilting melodies. How do you think my voice could have changed so much in ten years???? Even if I can’t sing it, I want to wish all of
you the happiest of holidays. 1989 has brought a lot of changes in our life and lots of fun and laughter, too.</p>
<p>Nasr has had a busy year. Yes, the son of gun got to travel again. This year he went to the French Island of Corsica, Egypt and Denmark. This is
all business!?! Let me tell you about his business. On the sunny warm island of Corsica overlooking the Mediterranean is where they hold their
conferences. They confer from 9am to noon. Then these poor souls are forced to lie on the beaches absorbing the local color and attractions.
Now, during this sacred holiday time I will not say what these beaches are lacking, but I’m sure with a bit of imagination you can all see what
he saw. Nasr suffered two weeks of this torture and then went on to spend a wonderful week with his parents and then another week in Denmark.
Oh, yes, Nasr does work. He spends long days at the University and this year he is vice-chairman of the department. Oops, I forgot, he’s also
been to Japan two or three times this year. I can’t be too accurate because it’s hard to keep track of where he is and when.</p>
<p>Virginia survived the month that Nasr travelled. I won’t say there weren’t any casualties, only my sanity, and my lilting voice, but I pulled
through and I’m able to continue until his next trip. As a mother, I worked very hard. Now, as a working mother I work very, very, very hard. I
heard the horror stories of working mothers, but I didn’t think they were real. Believe me, any story you’ve heard has to have been watered down
because the real picture is too blood curdling and too much to bear. I still have all my mother duties such as helping with homework,
chauffeuring, cooking, chauffeuring, cleaning house, chauffeuring, laundry, chauffeuring, bills and chauffeuring. But now I have all the duties
of a person. I’m going to school and taking two classes for my education credential, and I’m studying Spanish. I still work part time for Weight
Watchers and I’m a substitute teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. I love teaching, but being a substitute has its ups and downs.
Remember the days you had a substitute? How did you behave? Believe me, what you did “ain’t nuthin” compared to what these kids can do if they
want to. I sub in the Spanish bilingual classes and these classes can be wonderful or if they want, they can completely shut you out just by
speaking very swiftly in Spanish. (Now you know why I’m studying Spanish.) At least with teaching, I’m home in the afternoons when the children
are home. 1989 has been packed full of things for Virginia, and to tell the truth I’m a bit leery to open the doors on 1990. The 90’s are
supposed to be a busy time for everyone. If its going to get busy I think they better reserve a room for me with padded walls.</p>
<p>Amira will be ten in January. Or maybe I should call it ten-teen. If I’m getting preview of the years to come, turn it off. I like surprises. I
can wait. The only problem is that she can’t wait. Amira is doing very well in school and she is still taking piano lessons and doing
wonderfully at her recitals. However, practice time seems to be cutting into her time with her friends so we do have a few minor skirmishes over
that. Amira’s newest interest is cheerleading. She and a friend started a cheerleading squad at her school and they spent a lot of time working
on it. The only problem is that whenever you try to talk to Ami (she likes the shortened version) , she is jumping around and swinging her arms
in some sort of cheer. I feel my head is bobbing up and down just trying to keep up with her. Even at the table she’s talking, eating, twisting,
jumping and rah rahing all through dinner. I’d like to think she’s cheering on my food, but most of the dinners I make now are not up to her
taste. I usually hear, “Ah Mom, that’s gross!” Rah! Rah!</p>
<p>Adam is seven and will be very successful in life. Anyone who is that strong willed will get his way if it kills him, or breaks the eardrum of
his opponent. We have a future karate champion in the house. Already Adam is winning trophies and medals in the tournaments. I’m not sure who is
prouder of his accomplishments, Adam or Dad. Adam is doing very well in school and is reading just about anything he can get his hands on. Radar
and Adam are inseparable. Well, almost. Adam loves the cat and you could say he loves her to death. If he wants to hold the cat he is GOING TO
HOLD THE CAT and it is unimportant that Radar doesn’t want to be held. We are trying to convince him that when Radar growls she wants to be let
go, but Adam doesn’t seem to understand. Even the scars across his face haven’t convinced him. Now, you’d think that Radar would be smart and
try to avoid the THE TRAPPER as we call Adam, but the minute he wakes up she is following him around from room to room. Adam has a kind heart
for animals. Due to Jasmine’s generosity with the fish food, (she dumped the entire can of food into the tank) we lost our fish. There was one
fish floundering and Adam rescued it and the three children tried to give it mouth to mouth resuscitation. (They used a straw). Their idea made
sense, but fish need oxygen in the water and they were blowing carbon dioxide into it. But, remember, it’s the sentiment that counts.</p>
<p>Jasmine, at three, has a flair for fashion. She insists on wearing certain outfits and believe me she refuses very loudly if in her opinion a
particular outfit is “UGWI”! Her favorite clothes are Amira’s summer dresses that are so long that she trips over the hem. She has a preference
for ruffles and going barefoot. The neighbors call her the Gypsy Queen because they used to see her running up and down the sidewalk in her long
dress, long blonde curls and barefoot. In another of her fits of fashion, Jasmine decided to cut her hair. She really knows what is in fashion
because she gave herself a perfect mohawk. The only thing she forgot was the gel. She now has very short hair, but it fits her personality.
Because her hair is so short, I try to decorate it with pretty feminine bows and headbands. I bought a very pretty headband with a pink bow on
the top. Jasmine has no desire to wear the bow on top of her head, she puts it on her forehead and she looks like a doctor wearing that mirror
type thing on his forehead. Maybe this is a preview of her future profession, or maybe it just tells us how off the wall our daughter is.</p>
<p>1989 was wonderful for us and we pray it was as good for all of you and that 1990 will be filled with happiness and joy for all.</p>
