    "SEASON'S GREETINGS!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another year has passed and I'm not ready to write a Christmas letter. Give me another couple of months and maybe I'll be ready for Christmas.\n",
    "But then again I just may procrastinate and end up writing, buying and wrapping in the last two weeks just like I am now. Maybe when technology\n",
    "gets better I'll be sending you a video of the events of the year. Wouldn't that be great. I'd have a camera going all year long in each room of\n",
    "the house. Then I'd just edit out the \"good stuff and pass that along. Egads! Can you imagine how long it would take to edit a whole year of\n",
    "five people's lives? I guess I'll stick to my ancient ways of using the word processor and laser printer.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASR has been home most of the year and now I don't have much to complain about, nor do I get to describe those beautiful picturesque places\n",
    "that he has visited. Starting in January he's taking a sabbatical so maybe next Christmas I'll describes scenes of beautiful downtown Santa\n",
    "Barbara! Well, he can't travel the world every seven years. If he did, life would get pretty boring and what would we have to look forward to?\n",
    "As of this summer, you can call my husband Farmer Nasr. He planted over 60 tomato plants and almost as many lettuce plants. We are still eating\n",
    "tomatoes and will be for quite a while. There were too many lettuce plants even for this family of rabbits to eat and many of them went to seed.\n",
    "But never fear, even after tilling everything under, the lettuce plants are coming back in full force and there are close to a hundred little\n",
    "plants sprouting. If they survive the \"winter\" we may not have to buy lettuce for quite a while. Yes, Nasr has been working this year. He's been\n",
    "busy consulting, researching and teaching. He's also been forced to help get the kids ready for school in the morning. At first it was pure\n",
    "torture for him, but now he's got it down to an art. Actually, I think the kids like it best when Dad makes breakfast because he makes fun\n",
    "things like hash browns, eggs, waffles, and special toast sandwiches. (Mom doesn't eat that wonderful stuff so there's no way that she'll make\n",
    "it. But the rest of the family all think its great.)\n",
    "\n",
    "VIRGINIA has spent the past year doing her stint of student teaching. Actually it is slave labor, but school boards and universities don't like\n",
    "to call it that. Imagine putting in 8 to 10 hours a day for four months trying to control and teach 30 \"wonderful\" children and getting paid\n",
    "zip! I can't complain because now its over and I'm officially a TEACHER. I never knew what a teacher really did until I worked as a substitute\n",
    "and did my internship. It may be different in the midwest, but teachers just can't impart academic information, they have to be the be all to\n",
    "end all to the children in the classroom. This year I'm teaching a classroom of Cambodian children. These children have seen more cruelties and\n",
    "inhumanities to man than all of us combined have seen. They are not easy to teach, but when I do reach and teach them, it's a special moment.\n",
    "When it comes to writing, I think my next book will be the wonderfully sad, funny and poignant moments in a classroom of young modern\n",
    "immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMI (AKA Amira) is an 11 year old young lady of surprising talents. I never imagined that Ami would be an athlete, but this year she has shown\n",
    "what she can do. In the spring she competed in track and won several ribbons and medals. This fall she's out for soccer and their team is going\n",
    "to be playing in the play-offs. Ami and her best friend, Rachel are inseparable. They look like Mutt and Jeff and if you find one of them,\n",
    "you'll find them both. My little girl is now a sixth grader and she's desperately trying to teach Mom what is cool. I've learned it is not cool\n",
    "to blow you nose because well, you know, someone might hear it. But the thing that ignorant, uncool Mom can't figure out is, why is it cool to\n",
    "breathe through your mouth, sound like your dying and have \"yuck\" streaming out of your nose? If anyone can tell Mom why the first is uncool and\n",
    "the second is cool, please write and explain. Everyone these days seems to have a wide variety of the different sizes and shapes of water\n",
    "bottles. Ami is no exception. One minute Ami and Rachel have their matching water bottles, which are colorful baby bottles and are happily\n",
    "drinking from them. The next minute she gets a call from one of the boys in her class. It's true, they grow up in a flash.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM is 8 and is all rough and tumble boy. He's doing wonderfully in school and his ability to memorize is going to take him places. He told his\n",
    "Dad he's going to go to school a few extra years so he can learn even more. (Dad cringed, because at one point he contemplated paying for the\n",
    "childrens' education.) Adam is out for soccer also this year and he and his Dad have great games. I haven't decided who cheats more, but Adam\n",
    "makes the most noise so I'm inclined to think it's Dad. Adam and Mom like to go hiking together, particularly in the winter. We've discovered\n",
    "the park that has yellow prairie grass that looks as smooth as lions fur. Adam pointed out the grey brush that looks like the prickly hair of an\n",
    "elephant. The rocks have faces, puppies and dragons carved by nature. With Adam's imagination he may be a writer like Mom because when we come\n",
    "home from hiking Adam heads for the computer and starts writing about where we've been and what we've seen for extra credit in school. (Maybe\n",
    "Adam will be writing his Christmas letter and describing all the scenic places he's been.)\n",
    "\n",
    "JASMINE is four and going on about 37. I'll never worry about Jazz succeeding in this world. At UCLA when she was getting yogurt with her Dad\n",
    "she wanted the chocolate Jimmy's. Dad said no. She screamed, ranted, raved and insisted. So to shut her up, the woman behind the counter gave\n",
    "them to Jazz. She's learning early that squeaky wheels get oiled. But I'm afraid that one day, someone is going to grease her good! As a treat\n",
    "for Nasr we were given several pigeons to barbecue. I was cleaning them when suddenly I realized that hanging onto the neck was a dangling head.\n",
    "Ughhh. I screamed and informed Nasr if he was to eat pigeon he had to behead the birds. Jasmine was watching this whole scene and wouldn't allow\n",
    "Nasr to throw the heads away. She tried licking the heads, but Mom held back a scream and told her we don't lick unattached heads. She had\n",
    "several long conversations with these heads and then she decided that Butterscotch, our dog, should have the heads. But the dog is smarter than\n",
    "I thought. She wouldn't have anything to do with those heads. This worried Jasmine so she asked if we should call the police because the\n",
    "Butterscotch wouldn't eat the head. I calmly told her it really wasn't a matter for the police. She looked at me with those big blue eyes and\n",
    "said. \"Oh, then we'll have to call in the army!\" I don't know how Jazz thought the army would help, but as the holiday seasons approach I hope\n",
    "that the U.S doesn't have to call out its army and that this holiday season will be filled with peace. I also pray that this letter finds each\n",
    "and every one of you in good health and brimming with happiness."

    "SEASON'S GREETINGS!\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you believe that I wrote \"Seasoned\" greetings? That Freudian slip is very appropriate. The Ghoniem life is seasoned with fanciful and exotic\n",
    "spices and interspersed with coffee dregs. But, it's been a good year for us two \"seasoned\" veterans of child rearing. Each year the seasoning\n",
    "gives us more wisdom and we are able to philosophize about life. We've learned why children are so fascinated with the Merry-Go-Round. It\n",
    "teaches them when they are our age, uhm-over 21, that life really is a merry-go-round. However, I better teach my children how to get off it.\n",
    "Right now I'm riding the confounded thing and it doesn't stop, and I can't get off. Anyone who has any good suggestions on how to get off,\n",
    "painlessly, please write.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASR, over 21 a couple of times plus, has had a great year. He took a six month sabbatical and spent it in Santa Barbara. This would have been\n",
    "fine with me, but I found out that the engineering building is only a quick hop to the beach. He spent his lunch hours studying on the sand.\n",
    "However, the only structural analysis he was making was on the young co-eds in their bikinis. Don't you feel sorry for a guy who has to do such\n",
    "gruelling tasks? Also, Nasr's parents spent a wonderful and helpful 6 months with us. Nasr got the chance, for the first time, to do some\n",
    "carpentry work with his father on projects for the house. When it was all over, they were like identical twins beaming with pride. Nasr is\n",
    "busier than ever this year teaching and consulting. His merry-go-round is keeping him so busy that we sometimes wave as we keep circling.\n",
    "\n",
    "VIRGINIA, at least 21, is busy working full time at Gault Street as the afternoon kindergarten teacher. I'm finished with my clear credential!\n",
    "YEAH! Last week was the greatest thrill of my \"seasoned\" life. A waiter, (half my age) wanted to make sure I was 21. I was so pleased that he\n",
    "got a kiss. I think he'll be more careful who he cards from now on. My writing has only been academic papers, but I'm hoping next semester I'll\n",
    "have a chance to be creative again. I'll fit it around the several Spanish courses I'll be taking so I can communicate with the children in my\n",
    "classroom. I've also set a goal for second semester. My goal is to make dinner two nights a week. If you ask Nasr, (be careful, he may grumble\n",
    "and growl) he'll tell you that I only cooked two meals all semester. Whoever invented already prepared frozen foods will be in my will-well\n",
    "she's at least in my prayers because she gets enough of my paycheck as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMIRA will be 12 on January 6. She still prefers to be called Ami, but Mom at least has to use her official name once a year. She is in the 7th\n",
    "grade and taking honors classes. It's not that I'm proud of my daughter, but she got straight A's in her honors classes. (Of course, we all know\n",
    "where she got her intelligence from. Be careful how you answer that!) We say thank God she has the capabilities and pray she'll do something\n",
    "profitable with them. (When she was 5 she promised to buy Nasr and I a Mercedes when she got out of college. Hopefully, she'll use her brains to\n",
    "make lots of money. I'm waiting for my Mercedes. Remember, I'm a teacher; I can't buy it on my salary.) Ami was in soccer again this year and\n",
    "her team did quite well. Ami is also good in athletics and won the sportsmanship trophy. Ami is successful because she has a method for\n",
    "everything. Ami's bed is always made and her method for keeping her bed made is that she never sleeps under the covers. She grabs an extra\n",
    "blanket, suffers by being cold, but mind you, her bed is ALWAYS made.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM is 9 and in the fourth grade. He is doing great in school. He is on the student council, involved in lots of activities and is even in 5th\n",
    "grade math. Adam is one of the best players on his soccer team and now they have made it to the play offs. Adam also won the sportsmanship\n",
    "trophy. (Mom's merry-go-round will slow down a little now that she's not chauffeuring to soccer 4 nights a week. YEAH! Oops, that slipped out.)\n",
    "Adam is a very environmentally concerned child. He knows more about the environment and what horrible things we adults are doing to it. He has\n",
    "big plans to clean up the earth and make it a better place to live. (I hope he's more successful at that than he is with cleaning up his room.\n",
    "That is an environmental hazard.) Once Adam gets engrossed in a project or in many cases, gets mesmerized by the television, he has a hard time\n",
    "focusing on what he should be doing. I'll know because many a day I'll find the legos in the refrigerator and the food on the counter, or find\n",
    "the t.v. remote control in the cupboard next to his chips. But even though he sometimes has a hard time focussing on the issue at hand, other\n",
    "times he hits it right on the head, or in this case, right on his Dad's head. He looked his Dad straight in the eye and said, \"Daddy, is the\n",
    "shiny spot on your head the light from the light bulbs inside your brain when you get an idea.\" (Some people might call it a bald spot.)\n",
    "\n",
    "JASMINE is 5 and going on 35! She's in kindergarten and according to Jazz, life in kindergarten is great! She's now a game leader and she's\n",
    "losing a tooth. Those are the two most important aspects of kindergarten. Last Easter we got chicks and bunnies for the children. Well, bunnies\n",
    "turn into RABBITS, and chicks turn into CHICKENS. I never could acquire any affection for chickens, but Jazz adopted these two birds and loves\n",
    "them dearly. She hugs grown chickens like I would hug a puppy. She clucks to them and yes, they do answer her back. They seem content to be\n",
    "squashed onto the chaise lounge so Jasmine can have their full attention. Jazz is into the question stage of her life. One question I got was,\n",
    "\"Who is Mississippi?\" \"It's a big river,\" I answered. She frowned, looked very puzzled and then said, \"Oh. I thought there was a teacher named\n",
    "Miss Issippi.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One Saturday, not too long ago, the house desperately needed to be cleaned. (Nasr was coming home from one of his trips and I didn't want him to\n",
    "see how we really live when he's away.) The only way the cleaning was going to get done was if the children helped to clean it. I put on my 50's\n",
    "and 60's music very loud. (I think the loud part pleased the children the most.) And miracles of miracles, all three children started cleaning\n",
    "and they cleaned WITHOUT fighting. Adam was enjoying the music so much that he grabbed a broom and started dancing with it. Ami took the vacuum\n",
    "cleaner hose and used it as a microphone. She put on a great show. Jazz danced and was too busy having fun to mess up what was already cleaned\n",
    "up. Maybe the conservatives from the 50's were right when they said there was some sort of subliminal messages in the music. If it made my\n",
    "children clean without fighting, hey I'm all for it. This letter is long, but a lot happens in a year. I wish I could sit with everyone of you\n",
    "and hear your stories. Friends and family are precious gifts and I wish I could spend more time with each one of you. But remember, if you can\n",
    "read this, you can also write us and tell us your news or call on the phone. Jasmine has a very clear understanding of how useful a phone is.\n",
    "She knows it allows you to communicate with important people. One of her questions was, \"What's God's telephone number?\" I don't have God's\n",
    "number, but I do try to stay in touch. I hope all of you are blessed with good health and happiness and by the way, if anyone does know God's\n",
    "number, please let me know what it is.\n",
