<p>SEASON’S GREETINGS!</p>
<p>Another year has passed and I’m not ready to write a Christmas letter. Give me another couple of months and maybe I’ll be ready for Christmas.
But then again I just may procrastinate and end up writing, buying and wrapping in the last two weeks just like I am now. Maybe when technology
gets better I’ll be sending you a video of the events of the year. Wouldn’t that be great. I’d have a camera going all year long in each room of
the house. Then I’d just edit out the “good stuff and pass that along. Egads! Can you imagine how long it would take to edit a whole year of
five people’s lives? I guess I’ll stick to my ancient ways of using the word processor and laser printer.</p>
<p>NASR has been home most of the year and now I don’t have much to complain about, nor do I get to describe those beautiful picturesque places
that he has visited. Starting in January he’s taking a sabbatical so maybe next Christmas I’ll describes scenes of beautiful downtown Santa
Barbara! Well, he can’t travel the world every seven years. If he did, life would get pretty boring and what would we have to look forward to?
As of this summer, you can call my husband Farmer Nasr. He planted over 60 tomato plants and almost as many lettuce plants. We are still eating
tomatoes and will be for quite a while. There were too many lettuce plants even for this family of rabbits to eat and many of them went to seed.
But never fear, even after tilling everything under, the lettuce plants are coming back in full force and there are close to a hundred little
plants sprouting. If they survive the “winter” we may not have to buy lettuce for quite a while. Yes, Nasr has been working this year. He’s been
busy consulting, researching and teaching. He’s also been forced to help get the kids ready for school in the morning. At first it was pure
torture for him, but now he’s got it down to an art. Actually, I think the kids like it best when Dad makes breakfast because he makes fun
things like hash browns, eggs, waffles, and special toast sandwiches. (Mom doesn’t eat that wonderful stuff so there’s no way that she’ll make
it. But the rest of the family all think its great.)</p>
<p>VIRGINIA has spent the past year doing her stint of student teaching. Actually it is slave labor, but school boards and universities don’t like
to call it that. Imagine putting in 8 to 10 hours a day for four months trying to control and teach 30 “wonderful” children and getting paid
zip! I can’t complain because now its over and I’m officially a TEACHER. I never knew what a teacher really did until I worked as a substitute
and did my internship. It may be different in the midwest, but teachers just can’t impart academic information, they have to be the be all to
end all to the children in the classroom. This year I’m teaching a classroom of Cambodian children. These children have seen more cruelties and
inhumanities to man than all of us combined have seen. They are not easy to teach, but when I do reach and teach them, it’s a special moment.
When it comes to writing, I think my next book will be the wonderfully sad, funny and poignant moments in a classroom of young modern
immigrants.</p>
<p>AMI (AKA Amira) is an 11 year old young lady of surprising talents. I never imagined that Ami would be an athlete, but this year she has shown
what she can do. In the spring she competed in track and won several ribbons and medals. This fall she’s out for soccer and their team is going
to be playing in the play-offs. Ami and her best friend, Rachel are inseparable. They look like Mutt and Jeff and if you find one of them,
you’ll find them both. My little girl is now a sixth grader and she’s desperately trying to teach Mom what is cool. I’ve learned it is not cool
to blow you nose because well, you know, someone might hear it. But the thing that ignorant, uncool Mom can’t figure out is, why is it cool to
breathe through your mouth, sound like your dying and have “yuck” streaming out of your nose? If anyone can tell Mom why the first is uncool and
the second is cool, please write and explain. Everyone these days seems to have a wide variety of the different sizes and shapes of water
bottles. Ami is no exception. One minute Ami and Rachel have their matching water bottles, which are colorful baby bottles and are happily
drinking from them. The next minute she gets a call from one of the boys in her class. It’s true, they grow up in a flash.</p>
<p>ADAM is 8 and is all rough and tumble boy. He’s doing wonderfully in school and his ability to memorize is going to take him places. He told his
Dad he’s going to go to school a few extra years so he can learn even more. (Dad cringed, because at one point he contemplated paying for the
childrens’ education.) Adam is out for soccer also this year and he and his Dad have great games. I haven’t decided who cheats more, but Adam
makes the most noise so I’m inclined to think it’s Dad. Adam and Mom like to go hiking together, particularly in the winter. We’ve discovered
the park that has yellow prairie grass that looks as smooth as lions fur. Adam pointed out the grey brush that looks like the prickly hair of an
elephant. The rocks have faces, puppies and dragons carved by nature. With Adam’s imagination he may be a writer like Mom because when we come
home from hiking Adam heads for the computer and starts writing about where we’ve been and what we’ve seen for extra credit in school. (Maybe
Adam will be writing his Christmas letter and describing all the scenic places he’s been.)</p>
<p>JASMINE is four and going on about 37. I’ll never worry about Jazz succeeding in this world. At UCLA when she was getting yogurt with her Dad
she wanted the chocolate Jimmy’s. Dad said no. She screamed, ranted, raved and insisted. So to shut her up, the woman behind the counter gave
them to Jazz. She’s learning early that squeaky wheels get oiled. But I’m afraid that one day, someone is going to grease her good! As a treat
for Nasr we were given several pigeons to barbecue. I was cleaning them when suddenly I realized that hanging onto the neck was a dangling head.
Ughhh. I screamed and informed Nasr if he was to eat pigeon he had to behead the birds. Jasmine was watching this whole scene and wouldn’t allow
Nasr to throw the heads away. She tried licking the heads, but Mom held back a scream and told her we don’t lick unattached heads. She had
several long conversations with these heads and then she decided that Butterscotch, our dog, should have the heads. But the dog is smarter than
I thought. She wouldn’t have anything to do with those heads. This worried Jasmine so she asked if we should call the police because the
Butterscotch wouldn’t eat the head. I calmly told her it really wasn’t a matter for the police. She looked at me with those big blue eyes and
said. “Oh, then we’ll have to call in the army!” I don’t know how Jazz thought the army would help, but as the holiday seasons approach I hope
that the U.S doesn’t have to call out its army and that this holiday season will be filled with peace. I also pray that this letter finds each
and every one of you in good health and brimming with happiness.</p>

<p>SEASON’S GREETINGS!</p>
<p>Can you believe that I wrote “Seasoned” greetings? That Freudian slip is very appropriate. The Ghoniem life is seasoned with fanciful and exotic
spices and interspersed with coffee dregs. But, it’s been a good year for us two “seasoned” veterans of child rearing. Each year the seasoning
gives us more wisdom and we are able to philosophize about life. We’ve learned why children are so fascinated with the Merry-Go-Round. It
teaches them when they are our age, uhm-over 21, that life really is a merry-go-round. However, I better teach my children how to get off it.
Right now I’m riding the confounded thing and it doesn’t stop, and I can’t get off. Anyone who has any good suggestions on how to get off,
painlessly, please write.</p>
<p>NASR, over 21 a couple of times plus, has had a great year. He took a six month sabbatical and spent it in Santa Barbara. This would have been
fine with me, but I found out that the engineering building is only a quick hop to the beach. He spent his lunch hours studying on the sand.
However, the only structural analysis he was making was on the young co-eds in their bikinis. Don’t you feel sorry for a guy who has to do such
gruelling tasks? Also, Nasr’s parents spent a wonderful and helpful 6 months with us. Nasr got the chance, for the first time, to do some
carpentry work with his father on projects for the house. When it was all over, they were like identical twins beaming with pride. Nasr is
busier than ever this year teaching and consulting. His merry-go-round is keeping him so busy that we sometimes wave as we keep circling.</p>
<p>VIRGINIA, at least 21, is busy working full time at Gault Street as the afternoon kindergarten teacher. I’m finished with my clear credential!
YEAH! Last week was the greatest thrill of my “seasoned” life. A waiter, (half my age) wanted to make sure I was 21. I was so pleased that he
got a kiss. I think he’ll be more careful who he cards from now on. My writing has only been academic papers, but I’m hoping next semester I’ll
have a chance to be creative again. I’ll fit it around the several Spanish courses I’ll be taking so I can communicate with the children in my
classroom. I’ve also set a goal for second semester. My goal is to make dinner two nights a week. If you ask Nasr, (be careful, he may grumble
and growl) he’ll tell you that I only cooked two meals all semester. Whoever invented already prepared frozen foods will be in my will-well
she’s at least in my prayers because she gets enough of my paycheck as it is.</p>
<p>AMIRA will be 12 on January 6. She still prefers to be called Ami, but Mom at least has to use her official name once a year. She is in the 7th
grade and taking honors classes. It’s not that I’m proud of my daughter, but she got straight A’s in her honors classes. (Of course, we all know
where she got her intelligence from. Be careful how you answer that!) We say thank God she has the capabilities and pray she’ll do something
profitable with them. (When she was 5 she promised to buy Nasr and I a Mercedes when she got out of college. Hopefully, she’ll use her brains to
make lots of money. I’m waiting for my Mercedes. Remember, I’m a teacher; I can’t buy it on my salary.) Ami was in soccer again this year and
her team did quite well. Ami is also good in athletics and won the sportsmanship trophy. Ami is successful because she has a method for
everything. Ami’s bed is always made and her method for keeping her bed made is that she never sleeps under the covers. She grabs an extra
blanket, suffers by being cold, but mind you, her bed is ALWAYS made.</p>
<p>ADAM is 9 and in the fourth grade. He is doing great in school. He is on the student council, involved in lots of activities and is even in 5th
grade math. Adam is one of the best players on his soccer team and now they have made it to the play offs. Adam also won the sportsmanship
trophy. (Mom’s merry-go-round will slow down a little now that she’s not chauffeuring to soccer 4 nights a week. YEAH! Oops, that slipped out.)
Adam is a very environmentally concerned child. He knows more about the environment and what horrible things we adults are doing to it. He has
big plans to clean up the earth and make it a better place to live. (I hope he’s more successful at that than he is with cleaning up his room.
That is an environmental hazard.) Once Adam gets engrossed in a project or in many cases, gets mesmerized by the television, he has a hard time
focusing on what he should be doing. I’ll know because many a day I’ll find the legos in the refrigerator and the food on the counter, or find
the t.v. remote control in the cupboard next to his chips. But even though he sometimes has a hard time focussing on the issue at hand, other
times he hits it right on the head, or in this case, right on his Dad’s head. He looked his Dad straight in the eye and said, “Daddy, is the
shiny spot on your head the light from the light bulbs inside your brain when you get an idea.” (Some people might call it a bald spot.)</p>
<p>JASMINE is 5 and going on 35! She’s in kindergarten and according to Jazz, life in kindergarten is great! She’s now a game leader and she’s
losing a tooth. Those are the two most important aspects of kindergarten. Last Easter we got chicks and bunnies for the children. Well, bunnies
turn into RABBITS, and chicks turn into CHICKENS. I never could acquire any affection for chickens, but Jazz adopted these two birds and loves
them dearly. She hugs grown chickens like I would hug a puppy. She clucks to them and yes, they do answer her back. They seem content to be
squashed onto the chaise lounge so Jasmine can have their full attention. Jazz is into the question stage of her life. One question I got was,
“Who is Mississippi?” “It’s a big river,” I answered. She frowned, looked very puzzled and then said, “Oh. I thought there was a teacher named
Miss Issippi.”</p>
<p>One Saturday, not too long ago, the house desperately needed to be cleaned. (Nasr was coming home from one of his trips and I didn’t want him to
see how we really live when he’s away.) The only way the cleaning was going to get done was if the children helped to clean it. I put on my 50’s
and 60’s music very loud. (I think the loud part pleased the children the most.) And miracles of miracles, all three children started cleaning
and they cleaned WITHOUT fighting. Adam was enjoying the music so much that he grabbed a broom and started dancing with it. Ami took the vacuum
cleaner hose and used it as a microphone. She put on a great show. Jazz danced and was too busy having fun to mess up what was already cleaned
up. Maybe the conservatives from the 50’s were right when they said there was some sort of subliminal messages in the music. If it made my
children clean without fighting, hey I’m all for it. This letter is long, but a lot happens in a year. I wish I could sit with everyone of you
and hear your stories. Friends and family are precious gifts and I wish I could spend more time with each one of you. But remember, if you can
read this, you can also write us and tell us your news or call on the phone. Jasmine has a very clear understanding of how useful a phone is.
She knows it allows you to communicate with important people. One of her questions was, “What’s God’s telephone number?” I don’t have God’s
number, but I do try to stay in touch. I hope all of you are blessed with good health and happiness and by the way, if anyone does know God’s
number, please let me know what it is.</p>
<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!</p>

<h1>December 1992<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1992" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>SEASON’S GREETINGS!</p>
<p>1992 has been a year to forget! It has been filled with trials and tribulations too numerous to recount and too boring to read about. Just
please pray that 1993 will be a little easier and less painful. But I’m here again to remind you of the antics of the Ghoniems and to let you
know we are still here and still in one piece. (We only have a few screws loose.) It’s surprising that we are still intact considering the
feeding frenzy that the children have when they come home from school. They will devour anything that is fried, fattening or fun and doesn’t
move. So there’s no standing still in this house.</p>
<p>Nasr, has now reached the age that he’s forgotten it. (However, his children do love to remind him.) Nasr is working hard at the University and
is also working on his consulting business. It keeps him very busy. This year Nasr has discovered how much fun a NEW computer can be. He has
spent endless hours getting the right programs and the systems adjusted perfectly. He also has played musical computer. He had a difficult time
figuring out where he wanted to put it. First it was in my kitchen taking up MY desk space and MY kitchen drawers. Then it was moved to a bigger
desk, which took up too much space in the nook. Now it is up in the study, which is great, but soon Nasr is getting a portable computer with
MORE POWER than this mega computer. I’m worried that soon the Ghoniem household will be taken over by computers and I’ll wonder whatever
happened to Nasr. This year Nasr did some more travelling. Virginia stayed home!!! He went to Egypt to visit the condo we bought on the
Mediterranean, and then played in Brussels with some good friends. He said he went there to work. What do you think his reason was for going?</p>
<p>Virginia, has not forgotten her age, she just chooses to ignore it, and prays it will start going backwards. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa and
he is going to give you a chauffeur driven limo. Well, if we are going to believe in fantasies, I might as well go for the gold. Actually, I’m
the chauffeur and I’m still driving Mom’s taxi-the station wagon. I have convinced myself this is a luxury mobile because IT’S PAID FOR! We went
in search of a status mobile and soon realized we would have to pay \<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(600 a month, plus \)</span>10,000 down. Hell, (oops I forgot this was a Christmas
letter) I mean Heck, my 1986 station wagon just grew in status in my eyes, especially considering that the school district has taken 12% of my
salary and is threatening to take more. The Union threatens STRIKE (like I said, pray 1993 will be a better year). I’ve started a new endeavor
to help offset the loss of salary. I think it is great and I’ll be talking more about it in future letters. Teaching is absolutely wonderful
this year. I’m teaching a second-third grade combination in English, even though there are 7 different languages spoken in the classroom. I
discovered that too many children cannot read the books that are written for 2nd and 3rd graders, so I’ve done some writing this year and
hopefully, somebody will like what I’ve done. Don’t hold your breath because too many writers have keeled over from expectations. When Nasr was
travelling, I had a visitor. The rain in California has produced an abundance of rodents. Yes, you guessed it, I found a small rodent (I don’t
want to say rat because that gives me the willy nillies) in my Jacuzzi BATHTUB! AAAAHHHHH!!!! You better believe I screamed, and screamed and
screamed. Nasr was playing in Belgium, he didn’t hear me. My children were asleep, they didn’t even roll over. Not ONE of the neighbors called
to find out if I was being murdered. (That was really scary. I knew I was all alone and had to deal with this creature myself. Meaning who could
I convince into helping. One neighbor just had heart surgery. Was this serious enough to get him out of his bed and save me? YES! But, I figured
he might look at it differently. Another neighbor works nights about 60 miles away. I realized he might find it hard to come and help during one
of his breaks. I only had one left. I was desperate. I called and found myself talking to his wife. I asked if her husband would be brave enough
to save me from a creature. She laughed and said he couldn’t save me, but she would. This wonderful, brave women showed up at my house minutes
later, I never left the bathroom, I didn’t want it to escape into my bedroom. She was armed with a net, and a pillowcase. She bravely put the
case over the mouse, scooped it up in a net and whisked it away in her van. Now do you know why I hate it when Nasr travels? He gets to play in
the Mediterranean. I get rats in my tub!</p>
<p>Ami, is only 25 days away from 13. HELP!! I know, I better enjoy these last few days before I have a real teenager in the house. I’m hoping that
somehow the teenage flaw is going to skip a generation and my children will not be inflicted with that monstrous disease “TEENAGE-ITUS”. I can
hear every parent of a teenager now. They are either thinking up ways to insure that my children get this disease because its not fair if I’m
spared. Or, they are laughing hysterically at my naivete. Ami is doing superbly in eighth grade. I couldn’t ask for better grades. She is a
beautiful, self-motivated, young lady. (So, I’m a little prejudice, it’s a mother’s prerogative.) Ami can save money very easily. She has a
spendable account in the bank (not a college fund) and she is counting the days until she can have her own ATM card. This is true power, a sign
of maturity, and a headache when you have your own ATM card. Hey, I can write her checks instead of paying her in cash, which I never have. Ami
(no, I didn’t get another daughter, she just doesn’t want to be called Amira) is still a kid at heart. She loves dress up. But no, she doesn’t
go through old clothes that are stuffed in the toy box. She dresses up in MY clothes from my closet. (They look better on her, too.) It is not
simple dress up. It is high tech dress up. She gets out the video camera, puts on a show, with several costume changes and then shows the
neighborhood her production. It’s not that I’m not proud of my daughter’s budding film endeavors, it’s just that when she is finished my closet
looks like a hurricane hit. Then, when it’s time to clean up she suddenly loses all energy, pep and personality. She turns into a whiny, tired
teenager. Yuck! Guess who has to clean up? Yes, you’re right. Ami does it.!!</p>
<p>Adam, is a handsome, energetic 10 year old. Adam is in the 5th grade at San Jose Highly Gifted Magnet. He is very ecologically minded. He always
tells me when I should be recycling or when I’m doing something I’m not supposed to do. (Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around? ) Well,
in many instances I do tell him what to do, especially, when I want him to help around the house. He wants to earn money, but he figures we
should give him money just because he EXISTS. Now, this is a difficult concept for Nasr and I to understand. We have always thought that you get
money if you work for it, but Adam definitely does not ascribe to that way of thinking. When I do try to tell him what to do, because of our
different philosophies on the need for work, the discussion often gets heated and a quite LOUD!. Why is it that when I tell him what he should
be doing, he doesn’t seem to accept it as well as I accept his little suggestions on saving the environment? Do you think it would help if I
explained to him that there is such a thing as noise pollution? You’re right. It would only add to the unnecessary hot air in the environment
and piles of other unmentionables.</p>
<p>When we do convince Adam that he must EARN his money, he does so very grudgingly. But once he has that money in his pocket, it immediately
starts to burn a hole. I think he must coat his money with an environmentally safe acid, because I’ve never known anyone who has to get money
out of his pocket , and into someone else’s hands faster than Adam. Adam and Jasmine have a running feud, but at the same time they are
inseparable. The other day, Jasmine was provoking Adam and I must say Adam used a great deal of self-control, because that is one thing Adam is
NOT known for. He turned to Jasmine with his dark brown eyes blazing and said, “When I’m awake and tired, I’m potentially dangerous.” Jasmine
was not astute enough to recognize the threat, but when a ten year old lets you know that he is potentially dangerous, look out! Is this a
statement of things to come? (I still think kids need to come with users manuals.) Finally, when you play marbles with Adam, be careful. He
plays by his own set of rules. Also, watch those hands!</p>
<p>Jasmine, is six and is in first grade. This little girl definitely takes after her mother in some ways. She is a true tomboy. She spends more
time with the boys than with the girls. She can rough and tumble with the best of them. (Just like dear old Mom!) This year Jasmine has fallen
in love with the Dalmatians. Almost every article of clothing she owns has a dalmatian on it. She must have 50 dalmatian items or more. I do not
think that it would be too much to ask that Disney sent us a personal Christmas card this year as Jazz has helped support them and has added to
their profits heavily. Now, I wouldn’t want anyone to call me a meddling mother, but Jazz is going to be a top notch business PERSON when she
grows up. Jazz is the exact opposite of Adam when it comes to money. She has no desire to spend any of her money. However, the one similarity
she does have with Adam is his philosophy about working for money. She is somewhat easier to convince she must clean up her room to earn her
money. She does not earn as much as the other two, but she tries to make up for it. If we tell her she will get 2 dollars a week for cleaning her
room, she will try to convince her dad to give her 2 dollars a DAY for cleaning her room. If anyone ever needs money, Jasmine is the one to go to.
During this Christmas season, when I watch Jazz counting her money I am reminded of Scrooge. Several times a day this child counts her money.
And she doesn’t like  20 dollar bills. It doesn’t look like enough money. She wants everything in ones. She uses several wallets and keeps asking for
more because the ones she has are too small. The other day she came up to me and asked me quite innocently, “Mom, can a five or six year old kid
start to be a millionaire?” It took a few moments to pick my jaw off the floor, but I smiled and said, “Of course!” If my child wants to be a
millionaire, I’m going to be the last person to discourage her, especially, when I can think of a few things I’d like to get that only my
millionaire daughter can get for me. So, if we have any long lost relatives out there who are looking to give a poor, put potentially successful
young lady a jump start, I’m sure she’d be willing to set up a meeting with you and BARGAIN a lot of your money out of you. By the way Mom, Jazz
has big plans for your oil wells once they come in.</p>
<p>The Ghoniems may not be millionaires, but we do have many riches. The antics of our children fill us with happiness (even when we’d like to
scream) , and Nasr and I have wonderful times together (when we see each other). It’s our family and friends that make us wealthy beyond
compare. It’s the fun, silly, sad and thoughtful times that we spend together that makes us real millionaires. I hope 1993 will bring everyone
peace, happiness and lots of laughter.</p>

<h1>December 1993<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1993" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Greetings and Felicitations of the Season!</p>
<p>Ok, I know felicitations is an archaic word but as time passes by I find that I’m getting more archaic also. (But under oath I will say that I
wrote that under utter duress.) This holiday season I tried to get my act together and get this letter out early. (My act is still in pieces so
you’re getting this closer to New Years than Christmas.) This year we did a lot of things together as a family. And yes, we still are together.
There are times when family togetherness can break up the family, but we somehow managed to muddle through. Perhaps the unusual, scenic,
Mediterranean atmosphere helped us appreciate each other. But I think the real reason we all got along so well was because there were enough
adults around. We were able to pawn off the kids for a little while so they didn’t drive us absolutely mad.</p>
<p>Nasr is at the age of forty-something now and we all love to remind him of his antiquity. He is still working at UCLA and he loves it (except
when he has to teach four hours a day!) Now those of us who are teachers of the younger persuasion (meaning we teach younger kids) teach six
hours a day, everyday, not every other day. Do you feel sorry for him? Me neither! But we do have to make allowances for those of advanced age.
Nasr also is the epitome of the absent-minded professor. The day after Thanksgiving I got my hair cut. It was very long, almost to the middle of
my back. I cut it to chin length. EVERYONE noticed it the minute they saw me. Nasr, sat down, told me about his computer problems, looked
straight at me for over an hour and didn’t mention a thing. Finally Adam took pity on him (Adam saw the smoke coming from my ears) and told him
that I cut my hair. Nasr called down from upstairs, “Let me see this haircut. What does it look like?” Can we blame this on his antiquity too?
We spent the summer in Egypt and Nasr had a wonderful time with his family and friends. He spent hours in the water and swam like he did as a
child. I haven’t seen him this relaxed in years. We enjoyed it so much that we want to go back every two years if monies allow!!</p>
<p>Virginia’s age is really-something she doesn’t wish to discuss. 1993 was a year of taking it easy. I wasn’t taking classes at the university,
but I still managed to work full time and earn 12 credits taking Spanish classes and getting my Language Development Specialist Credential.
Sounds impressive? It’s not. All it means is that I know how to teach English as a Second Language, and I get a little more money. Los Angeles
is back to a traditional school calendar. Last year was great, I had 8 weeks off in January and February and then about 3 months off in the
summer. This year I only get two weeks in December and I feel deprived. Egypt was great for me. It was the true vacation. I didn’t clean, cook,
or care for the kids. I played, danced, swam and talked. Did I mention I didn’t have to cook or clean or care for the kids? It was a real
culture shock for me when I came back to LA and I had to go back to being a mom and a responsible person. I guess I must have succeeded in being
responsible because this is how the three kids see me. Ami says I’m exciting and eccentric, Adam says I’m cool and Jasmine says I’m romantic.
It’s funny, they said all those nice things and they didn’t want anything. Maybe they are waiting to extract payment later. This could be a plot
to soften me up. Well, if at a weak moment, you see me open up my wallet and give them money or buy them something when they really don’t
deserve it, just remember they pre-paid in compliments and it makes Mom feel good.</p>
<p>Ami, days away from 14, is the true scholar of the family. She graduated from junior high this 1 spring as valedictorian. In layman’s terms,
that means she graduated with all A’s and was number one in her class. I wish I could take the credit for all these brains, but I think her
absent minded professor dad gets a lot of credit for that. This year Ami is taking geometry. Now, when I was in high school, about a hundred
years ago, I took geometry. So one evening when Ami couldn’t wake up her dad from a sound sleep (at 8:00 p.m.) to help her with her math, she
came to Mom for help. I thought I could help, but once she started stating all the postulates and theorems, I knew I was in BIG trouble.
(Remember, I’m the literary person in the family.) I took one look at those angles and I said “Those are angles that could maybe…
possibly….” Then my very intelligent daughter could read my mind and she said, “Oh, now I get it. This is the way it is done. “ She went on to
explain in full detail exactly what needed to be done. I panicked as I waited for the second question. Thankfully, she could again could read my
mind after a few uhms and ahs. Next time though I”m waking Nasr up. Why should I panic when math comes so naturally to him? Ami is really into
soccer this year. She has been playing every other day all season. She played her last game in the pouring rain and miraculously didn’t catch
pneumonia. She has been elected to play for the all-stars. She is very excited about this, but Mom was hoping she would get a rest from soccer
practice. Ami is also keeping up with her piano, but she is teaching herself. Ami liked Egypt, but she caught a miserable cough and it took four
months to get rid of it. She learned how to jet-ski in the Mediterranean and she can swim a great distance into the sea and back. One thing she
didn’t appreciate was the fact that in Egypt the carcass of the cow is hung outside the door of the butcher shop or restaurant and pieces of
meat are removed as needed. I almost got her to eat lamb, in a restaurant, in the desert, outside of El-Alamain, until she saw the meat being
carried in a pink, plastic bag on top of a car through the Sahara. After that, she wouldn’t even walk past the meat. She went out the back door
just to avoid the meat hanging in the doorway. But she had fun in Egypt!!!</p>
<p>Adam is eleven and dating. Yes, I said dating. However, this was done without Mom’s approval or KNOWLEDGE. The story he told Mom was that he was
going out with his friend. I found out several hours later, that he was at the movies double dating with his friend. If this was a Saturday
matinee, I might have been slightly miffed, but this was a Friday night and he walked down a major street in LOS ANGELES with only his friends.
He survived to talk about it, but I warned him if he even thought about dating before he was 21 I’d do something drastic. (I know he’s already
thought about it, so if you have any good suggestions of something drastic that I can do, please let me know. ) Adam is in the 6th grade and is
in junior high. It is hard for me to imagine that Adam is in junior high, but he is very tall and all too soon, he will be towering over me.
Adam is becoming much more helpful around the house when the mood strikes. It doesn’t strike very often, but when it does he manages to fix
things that Nasr has been avoiding. He fixed the outdoor lamp by his basketball hoop that Nasr ignored for a year. Do you think he had an
ulterior motive? Adam is still at the dreaming stage. Each week he is going to be something different when he grows up. He wanted to be a film
producer and movie-maker. The fact that they are filming a movie at the end of our street may play some role in the interest he has in this. He
talked for a long time with the producer of this movie and he wanted to make great movies, too. As of today, he wants to be an astronaut and an
engineer like his dad. He wants to take over his dad’s company once Dad has made it big. Adam’s got the business mentality. He’s a little
concerned about being an astronaut because they have to learn to be in isolation for long periods of time when they are travelling through
space.</p>
<p>He’s not so sure he can handle that because when he was in isolation for dating, he wasn’t happy at all. Adam is also becoming very musical.
He’s trying to take up the guitar and piano by teaching himself. He is a little more successful so far with the piano. He keeps hinting that he
wants to take guitar and piano lessons after Christmas, but I’m not so sure he’ll stay with them. I like the idea that he is taking the
initiative and doing it on his own. I even offered to help, but it seems that the times when he wants help and the time that I’m available to
help him don’t coincide. Adam also had a great time in Egypt. Adam is under the belief that whatever Nasr can do, he can do better, especially
when it comes to swimming in the Mediterranean. Nasr would swim out into the very deep water and Adam was his shadow. It scared me half to
death, but Adam didn’t stop to think that he was in water 50 feet deep or more. Maybe he’s used to being in deep HOT water with Mom.</p>
<p>Jasmine is seven going on 37. She is very grown up for her age and tries to use the most sophisticated language. However, it is her own
language. Like her mom, she finds great refuge in the “frig-derator”. It is amazing how all the cookies and chips in the house seem to
“sip-appear.” She loves to have meals of “piss-getti and hambugers”. I have a hot financial tip for all of you who follow the stock market. Make
sure you invest in any and every toy company that makes toy horses. If the amount of money we’ve spent on these creatures is any indication,
these companies are doing fantastic and making gobs of money. You guessed it, Jazz likes horses. You also might be wise to invest in paper and
crayon companies because if Jazz is not playing with the horses, she is drawing them. We received, as a gift, a picture of horses done in silk
that was painted by the daughter of the last emperor of China. Now, Jasmine, having such a recently famous name as Princess Jasmine, has decided
that her horse drawings are going to be as famous as the emperor’s daughter’s drawing. Let’s hope! Jasmine also rode her own Arabian horse
around the Pyramids in the Sahara desert. But I don’t think that it compared to the two painted and flocked ponies that came to the house for
her birthday. She rode them with the greatest of pride and tried unsuccessfully to convince Mom to buy her one. I know our house is zoned for
horses, but I know who would have to take care of them, and Grandpa just won’t give up his lifestyle in the cold, Wisconsin winters to take care
of these creatures. Or will you, Daddy?</p>
<p>This year has been an interesting and fulfilling year. Last week on my way to yet another test, (yes, I’ve been tested a lot this year in more
ways than one) I watched the haze of a cloudy sunrise over the mountains of the Angeles National Forest. I was listening to Christmas carols in
the new car (it’s a year and half old, but it’s new) and the haze almost looked like a thin blanket of snow. Maybe I wanted to see snow, not the
California haze, yet it gave me a real Christmas feeling. Sometimes in “sunny” California we need to feel the old feelings of Christmas and
home. No matter how old we are we will always see Christmas through the eyes of our childhood and mine was snowcovered, fun-filled and loving.
I’m hoping to inspire those good feelings in my children, but our children will see Christmas as a wildfire of flooding, landsliding happiness
and earthshaking love. I hope all of you will have your own special Christmas and your own wonderful memories that make each Christmas unique
and unforgettable. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Here’s to 1994! May it bring everything you desire and deserve?</p>
<p>Lots of love,//</p>
<p>Virginia, Nasr, Amira, Adam, Jasmine, Butterscotch (the dog), Jack (the bird), Sharky (the fish) and too many nameless, colorful rabbits.</p>

<h1>December 1994<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1994" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Shaky Greetings from L.A.</p>
<p>1994 started out with a bang! Then a crash and a boom. I love to “Shake, Rattle and Roll,” but not with my house for a partner. Yes, the
Northridge earthquake really hit us hard, both literally and figuratively. It is almost 12 months later and we are only in the middle of
repairing all the damage done to the house. (And we were one of the very lucky ones-many people totally lost their home.)</p>
<p>Nasr did some travelling this year, but for once I’m glad I wasn’t with him. He went to Russia and with all the stories he came back with, I’m
surprised we thought it was such a super power for so many years. He lived with no toilet paper, no soap, not enough food, and creatures
crawling in his bed. (The kids and I were merely living in a house covered in plastic and dripping with dry wall solution!!) Nasr looked in the
mirror a few months ago and realized he was starting to feel fat and look old. (Believe me, the grey hair has been around for a long time, but
he was trying to convince himself it made him look distinguished.) He went in search of his youth and found the UCLA gymnasium. He discovered a
new life of athletics, weight lifting and girl watching. He now feels as strong as Arnold Schwartzenegger. He has given up the idealism of
science and entered into the realism of Arnold. Wait for Nasr to be featured in his latest hit movie “Term Paper II.”</p>
<p>Virginia’s 1994 was like Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride! In January the earth took us for several jarring and rolling rides. Thank God for our friends who
let us come to their house to take showers during that first horrible week, and thank you to all the wonderful people who called from all over
the world to make sure we were all right. To recover from the stress of the earthquake we were invited to Las Vegas to get away from it all. We
had the opportunity to do some horseback riding. The kids got on the pretty palomino, Goldie, and she walked beautifully around the area. Now,
Virginia was reminiscing how she used to ride horses as a child,and she wanted to get on, too. It had been 30 years since she was last on a
horse, but its like riding a bicycle, you never forget. Right? Wrong!!! Goldie is used to following another horse and when that horse took off
at full gallop, so did Goldie!! Screaming and crying did not stop the horse. Whoaing did not stop the horse. I watched the desert fly by me
because Goldie was hurdling small stone walls, medium size cacti and various sized boulders. She turned and I wasn’t seated well and I did a
perfect 90 degree angle off her side, but I didn’t fall. I realized the only one who was going to stop this creature was me. I pulled on the
reins with all my strength and I finally got the 1000 pounds of muscle under my control. Once I got back to base, (it took a while) I got off,
kissed the ground, and felt extremely proud that I was, at one point, in control. Then I had to go change my pants. In 1994 I also spent a lot
of time with my family. Poor Mom, she now realizes that none of her children have grown up and none of us can do dishes quietly. (But I’d never
admit that to my kids.)</p>
<p>Ami is only weeks away from 15 and driving, but she still has a year before she can solo. One more year before I turn grey. (No comments from
the peanut section.) Ami’s motto is “Soccer is life, the rest is just detail.” She is on the high school soccer team and on a tournament team
that is going to Hawaii this summer. (I’m going with her. It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it.) Ami’s whole focus is on soccer. Right now
when you ask what she going to do when she grows up, she’ll tell you that she’s going to be a professional soccer player. She has plans to get a
soccer scholarship to go college. That’s ok with me as long as she gets the scholarship to Harvard or Yale. She will be the best educated
professional soccer player in the U.S. Then when she gets too old, like 28 or 29, her degree might still be good. Ami went to her first concert
this year and no longer do the girls swoon and faint just at the sight of the musicians, the musicians have to smash 3 keyboards on stage before
the audience is shouting for more. And now, she wonders why I worry. Haven’t got a clue? Do you?</p>
<p>Adam at 12 is a changed child. Adam grew up. Adam transformed from a screaming, fighting, belligerent son of a Ghoniem to a well behaved young
gentleman. This is one of the very few good things that happened in 1994. He is studying on his own without any prodding, his grades are better,
and he takes good care of little sister. I don’t know what happened, but whatever freak accident changed him to such a nice kid, I’m eternally
grateful. Adam is giving his dad a run for his money on the racquetball court. Nasr used to let Adam get a few points so he’d feel good, now its
Adam who is letting dad win. Nasr can still lift more weight, but if Adam keeps working out, Nasr may have to look for his youth in an old folks
home. Adam has a habit of falling on his fanny when we visit Wisconsin. We were there again this summer and Adam had a few scrapes. When Adam
was about 4 he fell off the wagon into the soft manure. This year he fell out of the second story of the barn onto the hard cement. Green Bay
hospitals can repair broken arms very well. That same morning, Adam was taking driving lessons with his dad. One of the two got too adventurous
and went onto the roads travelled by the Wisconsin State Police. Yes, he was stopped. Lucky for Adam the officer was in a hurry to help someone
else. Maybe his close scrape with the long arm of the law changed him or maybe he’s just growing up.</p>
<p>Jasmine at 8 is still a horse fan. As far as the eye can see in her room, there are horses. Wherever we go we have to find a horse for Jazz to
ride. She’s ridden in Egypt, Las Vegas and Colorado. Even though she never had any real lessons, she can handle a horse pretty well. She also
plays chess with Adam. At first she wanted to play with her big brother, but he didn’t have the time to teach her. He gave her the instruction
manual and she came back 10 minutes later and she was able to play and she can compete pretty well with him. (Nasr said it took him 10 years to
learn to play.) Jasmine has turned into a great reader and continues to do very well with her art. Most kids just make their lunch and go to
school. Jazz has to decorate her lunch bag before she would consider putting anything into it. We always know what she’s studying in school,
because her lunch bag has to coordinate with her studies, from reptiles to insects to mammals to yes, horses. If anyone is interested in
marketing lunch bag art, come to Jazz.</p>
<p>I was almost tempted not to write a letter because 1994 was such a bad year for us, but as I reminisce, there were some good times. And the good
times were because of our families and our very special, caring friends. Life has changed for us in Los Angeles. We’re not taking anything for
granted and we’re trying to improve the things we have. We try to appreciate each day as it comes. But no matter how bad it was, the great part
of 1994 is that our family came through the whole ordeal safe and sound.</p>
<p>I truly pray the coming year will bring good health and happiness to all. And no more rockin’ and rollin’!!!!</p>

<h1>December 1995<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1995" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Happy Holidays</p>
<p>December 1995 Happy Holidays, The mood is set with the chandelier twinkling overhead, carols playing softly in the background, the children
(including Nasr) are all nestled and sleeping in their beds and Mom is scurrying around frantically finding boxes for gifts, wrapping gifts,
untwisting the tangled tape from her fingers, and in general going nuts from the holiday madness. When people are asked what is their favorite
holiday, they often reply that it’s Christmas. My answer is the same. Yet, it makes me wonder with how crazy I am at this time of year, why do I
like it so much?  Now that I have the first round of gifts wrapped, it’s time for me to get my letter written. The only problem is that it’s a
few minutes after midnight. You got a better time to write a letter?</p>
<p>Nasr has spent the year rebuilding the house, AGAIN! Or shall I say, STILL. All I know is that we have been working on this house since the
minor earth movement in 1994. Nasr says we’ll be done sometime next year. If I write about house repair in my letter next year, you might find
words that are inappropriate for this time of year. I’ll believe that the house is done when I no longer have workmen traipsing through the
house. Nasr takes all the credit for designing the house. Any problems, it was the contractor’s fault. Nasr is making sure that this house is
not going to swing, sway, jump or budge during the next earth movement. I was told that remodeling was difficult on a relationship. AMEN!!!
Remodelling can try the patience of a saint and well, Nasr has been an interesting creature during this time, but I wouldn’t refer to him as
saintly. On top of the house, he is consulting (paying for the house, as in, no insurance), changing his areas of expertise at the University
and playing professor.   With all of Nasr’s grey hair, people find it hard to believe that he’s 21. Nasr’s new toy this year is his sound
system. It has everything from subwoofers to digital surround sound. Now, Nasr’s musical sound level is competing with his children.</p>
<p>Virginia has taken on a new responsibility at work. She is the coordinator, coordinating three federal programs at the school. It’s a challenge,
but she’s enjoying it. No matter how hectic it gets at work, it’s still much more relaxing than the crazy schedule she keeps at home. Three
wonderful children, who have endless needs to be chauffeured constantly, to the ends of the earth and soccer and basketball games, put a lot of
stress on Mom. I have made an earth shattering scientific discovery. Once a mother reaches middle age (of course I’m not referring to myself)
her hearing becomes very acute. A mother can hear music at levels that teenagers could never hear. A mother is constantly telling the children
to turn down the music and the children are screaming that they can’t hear it.   Another discovery is that husbands, once they have a mid-life
crisis and search for sound to surround them, their hearing reverts back to the low levels of a teenager. Yes, the noise in this house is
deafening and that only refers to the stereos, not the fighting, arguing and general “yuckiness” of having two teenagers in the house. The
highlight of my year was spending September in Wisconsin, helping Mom celebrate her 80th birthday. All the siblings were there. We’re all alike,
so you know that Mom must have been glad when we went home, so she could have the peace and quiet that I crave.</p>
<p>Ami will be 16 in 29 days and behind the wheel of a car. Yes, she will be getting her driver’s license. For Ami it is a sense of freedom. For
Mom and Dad, it’s a sense of worry and fear for her safety. She is a good driver, but let’s face it, this is Los Angeles. Her straight A’s will
at least help with the insurance. To be completely honest however, I do look forward to Ami driving because she will alleviate some of my
chauffeuring time.  Ami is still living, breathing and playing soccer. She went to Hawaii this summer and her team won the “Hawaii Cup.” Another
of her teams won the Division II AYSO sectionals. She’s playing on the high school team, practicing for three hours a day. She is usually
running around outside or walking in the house with a soccer ball under her feet. The best picture I have of Ami is when she had a deflated
soccer ball on her head after soccer practice. The soccer ball was her soccer crown, but the cat eyed, rose colored sun glasses really depicted
what a soccer princess we have.</p>
<p>Adam at 13 is tall. Adam is taller than Mom. Adam is taller than Dad. Adam’s head is so big from being the tallest, that he can’t fit it through
the door. He did manage to cut it down to size however this summer. As soon as school got out, he decided to cut his hair. His father dutifully
took him to the local discount hair stylist. Adam described what he wanted and he got it, but he didn’t like the style he wanted. He came home
and while Nasr was napping, Adam asked if he and his friend could fix it. Fix it has several meanings. The one meaning that Nasr was not
expecting was “shave it all off’. Nasr woke up from his nap to find the house covered in hair (most of the mess was in our bathroom), and Adam
was bald! I never thought Adam had big ears, but when you looked at him, all you saw were his Dumbo the Elephant ears. It happened that that
same evening he was invited to a black tie bar mitzvah. Now you must use your imagination when picturing my son. Remember, up until today, he
had long, black locks. Forget the locks, now his head is a pinkish black, about the same color as newborn piglets and about as scratchy. His
ears are sticking straight out from the sides. He has grown so much that the men’s size small suit just barely fits him. He is wearing a light
blue suit, that he insists on buttoning. He is very thin and now Adam looks like a long, blue hotdog. He does not own an appropriate pair of
shoes for this formal affair, so he borrows a pair of wingtips from his dad. Wingtips make your feet look large. Now we have a long, blue
hotdog, with oversized clown feet, with a piglet colored head and elephant ears. His dad’s large black shirt cuffs hang below the sleeves of the
suit and his tie is imprinted with bugs bunny dressed as a superhero. To give him a little class, he adds his glasses. I dropped Adam off and
prayed no one would recognize him as my son. Thank God his hair has grown back. I think his bad attitude about grades and studying was in the
old hair, because suddenly this year he realized that if you study, you get good grades and he’s doing it.</p>
<p>Jasmine at 9 is still our horse loving artist.  She goes to the Conservatory of Fine Arts for formal art classes. The conservatory is at a local
college and Jazz is very proud of herself that she goes to college at age 9. Of course, this is a major commitment for Mom. Every Saturday for
five hours I’m chauffeuring and chaperoning Jasmine. Jazz is doing very well in school this year, but she does have a hard time getting up and
getting ready for school. One cold morning about 6:45 Jasmine called over the intercom. “I’m not going to wake up until someone conies up and
wakes me up.”   Nasr dutifully went up and woke up his soundly sleeping daughter and she did get ready for school on time. I guess I really do
know why I like this time of year, even though it is hectic. We have a chance to reminisce about the year, talk with our friends and family,
share our gifts and good cheer. Why do I like the Christmas holidays the best?   Because Christmas is all about family and no matter how bizarre
they are, a family is the greatest treasure a person can have. I hope all of you are sharing and enjoying your families. (If I enjoy mine, you
gotta be having a good time!) Wishing you all good health and happiness for the coming year.   Let us know your news.</p>
<p>Love, Nasr, Virginia, Amira, Adam, Jasmine, Butterscotch, (dog ) and Lucy (cat) Ghoniem</p>

<h1>December 1996<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1996" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Happy Holidays,</p>
<p>I’m trying to get an early start on my letter this year, but early is a relative concept. By the time you actually get the letter, it may be
January or February. I have the music turned up loud so it will put me into the proper mood, but once I start writing and thinking about our
friends, I don’t need any outside stimulus to feel the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Nasr has been very busy this year. He is expanding beyond theory into the challenging field of experimental engineering. Bulky equipment fills
his laboratory and it looks a little like Dr. Frankenstein’s lab. There are thousands of wires and enormous power producers. He says he’s
working on the “plasma processing of materials to produce surface coatings for many applications.” (I would like a coating of mink to cover my
surface, but Nasr says he can only make diamond coatings. I guess I wouldn’t mind being the first on the block to have a diamond coat.) He is
travelling to Japan in December and he’s presenting pearls of wisdom to the academic community and then he’s bringing pearls on a necklace,
bracelet and ring to me. (I can dream, can’t I?) Nasr’s parents and sister visited us for two wonderful months. We did a lot of sightseeing,
shopping and visiting. Like many people in Nasr’s age group, he has realized the importance of exercise. We did quite a bit of bicycling this
summer, and he did purchase an immense weight machine and it is still waiting for us. Now ladies, don’t you agree that your husbands are your
Knights in Shining Armor. After 20 years of marriage, Nasr is still my Knight, even though his armor might be a little tight and tarnished.
Knights are supposed to slay dragons, and unfortunately for the Knights of today, there are no longer dragons. But, I believe that the modern
day dragons are those nasty ants that march into the house when it is too hot or wet outside. So, in order to maintain his Knightlyness, I feel
he should slay the ants. I’ll play Maiden in Distress, (I have mastered that role.) and he can slay the dragon ants. Don’t you agree?</p>
<p>Virginia is still coordinator at Gault Street School. When people ask me what I do, I usually tell them, “I do whatever needs to be done.” I’m
still taking tests for Spanish and busy playing Mom. I’m trying to knit an Afghan, and it’s already been claimed by all the children. Little do
they know, that it will most likely take me 15 years to finish it.</p>
<p>Amira (oops, I mean Ami) at 17 (in one month) is busy getting ready to go to college next year. She is more ready for it than we are. This young
lady is being constantly tested. She has to take dozens of alphabet soup exams, fill out college applications, write college essays, study for
her AP Calculus class, AP Chemistry, English, Physics, take piano lessons and she still has time to be captain of her high school soccer team.
Ami also has transportation. She thinks she is the only person in the world who has to drive a car that does not have enough power to get out of
the San Fernando Valley and is put together with duct tape (duct tape holds the light in place). According to Mom and Dad, she should consider
herself very lucky to have any sort of wheels that will get her from point A to point B. She, however, looks at it from a very different
perspective. Her car is ugly and she should drive a beautiful brand new car. Mom and Dad think we should pay for college first. What do you
think? I must admit she has been very helpful in driving the other children to wherever they need to go. Mom’s spoiled and doesn’t know what she
is going to do next year when she has to go back to driving.</p>
<p>Adam is 14 and has grown. He’s grown and grown and grown. He’s taller than Mom. He’s taller than Dad.   But, he’s not the tallest on his
basketball team, he’s second tallest. His best friend is the only one taller than him.   Basketball has become his forte. His freshman
basketball team won the High School League Championships. The girls were teasing him about having his name announced over the high school public
address system. You could tell how badly it bothered him whenever you looked up at his face and the sun glinted off his pearly whites.
Unfortunately, Adam’s vocabulary has become quite limited now that he is in high school. When Nasr asked Adam how was his day, Adam’s response
was a mumbled “Idno.” All his words are swished together and unintelligible. Nasr is sure he’s speaking a foreign language. The other day, after
Adam spoke to him, Nasr looked up at me with a puzzled look on his face and asked, “Can teenagers understand each other?” Guitar is the
instrument of Adam’s choice. He is taking weekly guitar lessons and is doing quite well. We bought him a guitar and amplifier in October. He
agreed that both the guitar and amplifier would be his Christmas present, but that was way, way back in October. Now in November he needs some
other $200.00 present. Does anyone else see something wrong with this picture?   Adam is also into computers.   He cannot spend time with his
friends without having the computer on.   Adam will invite a friend over and then Adam will sit on the computer downstairs and his friend will
sit at the computer upstairs. They play games against each other through the modem and talk to each other on the other telephone line. Yes, both
lines are tied up. Oh, and a word to the warning. Do not pick up the telephone line that is hooked to the modem as it immediately cuts off the
modem. Once that happens you will hear Adam screaming through the house, “You ruined it!   Who picked up the phone?   I’m going to kill you.” I
tried to explain to Adam that it would be much easier to sit and talk to his friend face to face and then we could use one of the phones, but I
didn’t get very far. Is this what technology brings?</p>
<p>Jasmine is ten and in the fifth grade.   She loves horses, loves art and hates to pick up after herself. She is attending the Conservatory of
Fine Arts at California State University Los Angeles. This year is much easier because several families are car pooling and I have a couple of
Saturdays free every month. Jasmine is a true artist. They can make everything so beautiful and so messy at the same time.   Jasmine moved to a
room that is well hidden from visitors. This is the only room that looks like “Twister” visits twice a day. But, a hotel room is an entirely
different story for Jazz. The minute we arrive, she has to put all her clothes on hangers. (Of course, that leaves no hangers for the rest of
the family.)   She even hangs up her dry beach towels. She walks around the room meticulously organizing everything on the tables, the bags, and
the contents of the refrigerator. Then, she stands in front of me, folds her arms and says “Can’t you even say thank you for cleaning?”   Where
did that come from?   She can’t pick up one sock in her room, but she plays maid in the hotel.   I’ve decided that I’m putting a sign outside
the door that reads “Hotel Ghoniem” maybe this way, Jazz will clean up her room.   I know, I love to dream.</p>
<p>The year has come to an end, but I’m ready for new beginnings.   Our home is once again a home, not a construction site.    I think I’ll really
have the Hotel Ghoniem sign made, not just for Jazz, but so all our wonderful friends can visit.   We pray that the new year will bring joy and
happiness to all our friends and family.</p>

<h1>December 1996<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Greetings of the Season!!!!</p>
<p>It’s over, but I haven’t started. You know the resolutions I made on January 1st, 1997, well, I haven’t gotten to them so the year can’t be
over, can it? Maybe I’ll just pretend I didn’t make them last year and everyone will think I made all new resolutions this year. (The only
problem is that they are the same ones I’ve made for the past 10 years and haven’t done.) Oh well, I’m always telling my kids that practice
makes perfect. I’ll practice keeping resolutions for 15 years and then I’ll start keeping them. Either that or I’ll just re-word them.!!!!</p>
<p>Nasr, (gonna be 50 this year) has kept several of his resolutions. He promised himself that he would cut down on his work, travel and go on a
sabbatical. He’s done and doing it! In order to pay for all the earthquake damage, poor Nasr has really been working 7 days a week 16 hours a
day. (Be smart, get insurance-or you’ll pay forever for your mistakes.) Not everything is paid, but a decent dent has been made so at least he
can take one day off and spend time with us. Another resolution was to travel. Of course he makes that resolution yearly because he’s gonna do
it whether it’s a resolution or not. (I think he does that to make me look bad.) He has traveled across, up and down the U.S., to Greece, to
Egypt, and THREE times to Japan. He’s happy to report that this year he swam in the Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and the Mediterranean. He also just
mentioned that he had a ball travelling. (I thought this was all work related, i.e. he is not supposed to have fun.–Resolution-Send a spy with
Nasr on his trips) It’s a good thing he tells me how tired he is of travelling after he comes home, because I can guarantee that I don’t have a
ball when I’m home alone with two teenagers!!! His final resolution is that he is going to take a sabbatical this year. Every 7 years he can
take a year off to study and increase his knowledge. As this is his third sabbatical, you know he’s been around UCLA a LONG time. He plans to
relax and spend the entire time at his computer writing. (Isn’t this what he does when he’s working-where is the sabbatical?) He is also going
to be playing Mr. Mom because Virginia has undertaken two full time jobs. I’ll send pictures of him in his apron. (Please send aprons in
assorted colors in large sizes. He’s always been partial to blue and sometimes ruffles.)</p>
<p>Virginia, (ain’t gonna say) is NUTS!! No, its not because I haven’t kept my resolutions. No, I’m not going crazy, I’m already certifiably
insane. Do you realize I chose, of my own free will, to go back to school and get my masters IN ONE YEAR!. I’m still working full time and I
have three children and I’ve lost my extra driver. Work has provided countless hours of overtime without the fringe benefits of MONEY.
Pepperdine is an outstanding university which is exciting, stimulating and exhausting. I’m afraid I may have to resort to using stimulants to
stay awake while I’m doing homework and “overtime.” Nasr will be Mr. Mom so I won’t have to drive too much and I’m hoping he will prepare the
meals. Now I know why men want to have their wives stay at home. Coming home to an already prepared meal is heavenly. Remember in my letters of
long ago, I craved for the time when my children would be grown and I could have adult conversation-especially when Nasr travels. Well, my
children have grown, but I’m still craving adult conversation. When I speak to Adam especially while he is deeply involved in his computer, his
response is a low guttural grunt with a all right just a second. However, Adam must have developed his own time, because his seconds last for
hours. Jazz is as equally involved with the T.V. She doesn’t bother to answer she merely ignores me. She thinks the intercom is meant to be
turned off. Ami, is so enamored with her beau, Mark, that she doesn’t even realize I’m talking, so I get no response. So, now you know when you
talk to me, if my responses just aren’t right, I guess I just haven’t had the practice.</p>
<p>Ami (17, few weeks away from 18) is grown up-sort of-well, she’s away at college-sort of-well, she’s home every weekend. But, Mom’s not
complaining because I do miss her when she’s gone. However, as you guessed, Mom’s not the reason why she’s home every weekend. (It ain’t Dad
either.) Ami is attending UCLA (wonder why she chose that place?) and her major is electrical engineering. She has wonderful roommates who are
lots of fun and very supportive. She is taking such advanced math classes that mom panics every time she thinks about it. Also, Ami realizes
that college is just a touch more difficult than high school. When Ami is home there is such a clamor to use the computers. Ami’s resolution was
to get a computer. Actually she wanted a car, but I just edited out the parts I can’t afford. So, she now took the old pentium to her dorm and
that left the household with only one computer. There are papers to write, e-mail to check on, Internet to surf and games to play. Yes, it is
sad sight to see the family fighting over who is going to use the computer first, but hey Mom did find out that weight is one advantage when you
are fighting for the chair in front of the computer. Maybe Ami should bring the other one back or Nasr should buy another one.</p>
<p>Adam (15) is TALL!! His resolution was to be taller than dad. He far surpassed his resolution. He has stretched to 6’2” and GROWING and eating
and eating and eating and staying so thin!!! I have to say that it is very disconcerting having to look up at your 15 year old. Adam is learning
how to drive. No, he may not drive my new Expedition. He can drive the Oldsmobile or the “Poomobile” as the children not so affectionately call
it. But hey, it’s wheels. Adam is very active. He’s on a club basketball team and on the high school volleyball team. He has to ride his bike to
school everyday and we tell him that this helps him be better prepared for his sports. He’s still not so sure he agrees with us, especially on
cold mornings. Adam has also made an amazing discovery. He discovered that if he puts in a little effort and studies~A’s happen! His report card
is proof of his discovery. I also think he very badly wants to get into UCLA and he knows that to get into UCLA you need almost a 4.0.</p>
<p>Jasmine (11 going on 27) is our preteen with a major teenage attitude. She hasn’t made any resolutions that I’m aware of but I’m sure when the
time comes she will be very vocal about her resolutions. I’m preparing for “LA NINA” in her teens. I have a feeling that the weather we are
experiencing now is just a prelude to what we will have. (My sisters are all saying-Yes! There is a God! I went through “phases” as my mother
put it and I believe my daughter is going through the same “phases.” I think somebody (older sisters) put a hex on me so I would have a child
just like me.) Jazz is into fashion and she lets me know how out of fashion I am. Jazz gets great grades in middle school and is determined to
get straight A’s. She’s into teen magazines, soccer, art, T.V, T.V, and T.V. She is in the most advanced art group at the Art Conservatory and
she is doing some outstanding work. I keep telling myself she is my artist and artists are always a little moody. (I wonder what my mom kept
telling herself? All I know is that I can “hear” her smile when I complain about my children over the phone.)</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds all of you healthy and happy. Even though the coming year may be filled with trials and difficulties to those close to
us, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Also, with the combined love and strength, we will all weather the difficult times and come out
stronger and better. Have Happy Holidays and a Happier New Year.</p>
<p>Lots of love, Nasr, Virginia, Ami, Adam, Jazz, Lucy (cat), and Butterscotch (dog) Ghoniem</p>

<h1>December 1998,<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1998" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Greetings from the Ghoniems!</p>
<p>This has been a year of celebrations and sadness.</p>
<p>Nasr celebrated his 50th birthday with a great deal of sadness, but it didn’t stop him from enjoying his sabbatical. Believe it or not, I think
he worked more during his sabbatical than he is working this year. (The guy is kind of backward.) At the end of his sabbatical, we took a
“Griswold” (Ghoniem) family vacation. Yes, we drove across the US, but we did it Ghoniem style. We invited Nasr’s brother, Gamal and his family
to take their vacation with us. We had a great time, but Nasr wanted to see the entire Western United States in less than two weeks. (We almost
accomplished it!) My sister-in-law, Magda took the three teenage boys in their car and gave me the three teenage girls. (I think she earned a
place in heaven for that.) You must picture two very large, sports-utility-vehicles crossing the wide, open expanse of the desert. At the
wheels, were two eager men clutching their miniature Citizen Band (CB) radios and reporting any evidence of police in the area. Sitting in the
passenger seats were two bleary eyed women reading maps, watching for road signs, and censoring the use of the men’s CB radio. DO NOT ask Nasr
to tell his 2-2-2 joke. The girls read magazines and the boys slept while we traveled from Los Angeles, to Laughlin, Nevada, to the Grand
Canyon, to Sedona, Arizona, to Las Vegas, to Bakersfield, Ca.and onto Yosemite National Park. If Nasr hadn’t gotten ill, we would have continued
on for another three days and visited 4 more cities along the California coast. (Lesson learned: Do not let Nasr plan any future trips because
he wants to do it all in 30 seconds or less.) Nasr had so much fun traveling this summer (or maybe he had too much “togetherness” with his wife
and kids), that he is traveling almost every month this school year. Since September, he has been to Spain and Chile and before I write to you
next year, he will travel to Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Portugal, Denmark and maybe Egypt. Don’t you feel sorry for him? At least feel
sad for me because I can’t go.</p>
<p>Virginia is 21 and holding. I finished my Master’s Degree the end of July, but I graduated in May. (Figure that one out.) Anyone who has seen my
graduation picture comments that my uncontrollable smile says it all. I’M DONE!!! I’M DONE!!!! I’M DONE!!!!!!!!!    Yes, I’ve been celebrating
the end of a tough year. To tell you the truth, I have not been looking very diligently for a job in which I can use my masters, because once I
get a vice-principal position, I have to go back to school for another 24 credits. AAAAGGGHHH. Educators are constantly being educated. I guess
they believe the statement that one can never know enough. Sunday morning is the time to clean the Ghoniem house and being the educator that I
am, I cannot let any educable moment pass. So, while the family is cleaning, we have a music history lesson. We listen to the music from the
70’s, 60’s and 50’s. Of course, I have to instruct them in the proper way to dance while listening to these tunes. The children roll their eyes
and continue dusting, but they are definitely picking up speed with their cleaning duties. By the time we are listening to the 50’s CD, I am
using the central vacuum hose as my electric guitar and am singing “Reelin and Rockin” by Chuck Berry. It is at this point that the kids are
shaking their heads and wondering about the sanity of their mother. They are also extremely thankful that the house can be cleaned within the
time span of three CD’s.</p>
<p>Ami will be celebrating her 19th birthday at the beginning of January, and is doing very well in her second year at UCLA. We had her all set up
to live in an $800 a month apartment for September. She moved back home in June and organized her room. This was the first time since the
earthquake that she put any real decorations on her wall. When it was all finished, she really liked the way it looked. (I do too, but don’t
tell her because it might scare her.) In early July she came up to me and asked “Why do I want to share a bedroom half the size of mine with two
other people?” I very coyly shrugged my shoulders and whispered, “I don’t know?” She now lives at home and commutes by bus. Mom is celebrating
having her close to home and Dad is celebrating not having to pay the extra $800 a month. Of course, we did entice her with a car as another
reason to stay at home. But, during the summer she drove to her job at UCLA and decided she’d much prefer to take the bus rather than fight the
daily LA traffic. Ami does sadly wonder though, if she will ever see the car that we have promised her.   Soccer is still a big part of Ami’s
life. She is continuing to participate in and win soccer tournaments. One of her requirements for college is a health course and she is learning
how important it is to eat right. She is putting everything she has learned to practice and is looking great. I’m glad my kids do as I say, not
as I do.</p>
<p>Adam turned 16 this summer and is celebrating his ability to drive, but sadly wonders why he has to drive the “Poo-Mobile” (AKA-Brownish
Oldsmobile Station Wagon). Even though this is not his vehicle of choice, Adam has made the best out of an embarrassing car and uses it to
expand his sports storage space. Surfboards, in-line skates, tennis rackets, basketballs, tennis balls, volleyballs, caps, jackets and
occasionally you will find a book or two underneath all the clutter. All children are a mixture of their parents. However, Adam has taken this
concept to a higher level. Adam’s beautiful wavy black hair (thank God it grew back after he shaved it off), is like two distinct puzzle pieces
that fit together perfectly. (Did I say Adam was a puzzle? Must be a Freudian slip.) The crown of Adam’s ebony hair is the same golden blonde
color as his mother’s hair. He got it the same way Mom did-out of a bottle. Now when people ask whom Adam looks like, we can legitimately say,
both of us.   (He took his passport picture with his hair like this and he will have to live with this image for 10 years. Of course, he can pay
for a new passport, but Mom ain’t gonna do it. Now, I need you to picture Adam (all 6 feet 2 inches of him) laying in a bed that is almost too
small for him. He has just finished a high school volleyball tournament in which he played 8 games and then he played a basketball game with his
friends. He is covered with a thick, heavy comforter that is pulled up to his neck and a black ski cap covers his head. (It gets pretty cold in
California in winter. It gets down to about 50 degrees.) Adam is reading his history book with Lucy, the cat, curled up at his feet and both are
listening to the melodic tones of classical music. I guess it is nice to know I have kids who do what they like to do, even if it is not
following the crowd. Except for his hair!!!!!.</p>
<p>Jasmine is 12 going on 27 and sadly she knows more than anyone does. (Except maybe Adam because he can argue longer and louder than she can.)
Jazz can be likened to the cartoon character “Pigpen” with an ATTITUDE. I know where Jasmine is and has been at all times. There is a trail of
books, jackets, shoes, socks, plates, glasses, paper wrappers, cream cheese containers, pizza crusts and half filled soda cans. Of course, she
will heartily argue that she didn’t make the mess. (But there was no one else at home.) And she is very upset, that we accuse her of being
messy. We have an intercom in the house that she conveniently turns off so she doesn’t have to hear us calling her-especially before and after
dinner. When she is asked why she didn’t answer. She will respond that she didn’t hear us. We don’t believe her and say, “But we called you four
times.” “No you didn’t, you only called twice.” BINGO!! She heard us, she just ignored us. ATTITUDE. Jasmine’s artwork is still spectacular. (Is
it a requirement that artists have an attitude?) She is following in her sister’s footsteps and plays soccer very well. (When she wants to.)
She has been wearing braces for a year now and the orthodontist is very pleased because she listens very well to him and is making great
progress. (Note: Talk to orthodontist and find out how he makes her listen and do so well.) In those moments when she is just Jasmine, she is
sweet and fun. My mother told my sisters when I was 12 that I was just going through a phase. Mommy, how long did it take me to get out of my
phase? (Be nice!)</p>
<p>Life is meant to be lived and enjoyed. The very sad part of life is that we cannot live forever. This summer I lost my 92-year-old father. It is
not something that I have come to terms with yet. I do know that what he is most remembered for is his sense of humor. That is a gift that Daddy
passed onto me. So whenever someone makes you smile, think of Daddy and how he made everyone around him smile.</p>
<p>I hope your New Year will find you healthy and will be filled with happiness and laughter. Remember, your laughter will be a gift from Daddy.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Nasr, Virginia, Amira, Adam, Jasmine, Butterscotch, the dog, Lucy, the cat, &amp; Cleo, the new, obnoxious kitty.</p>

<h1>December 1999<a class="headerlink" href="#december-1999" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>Another year has come and gone with good times and bad.</p>
<p>Nasr has been the happy wanderer this past year.  He has travelled to many cities in the U.S., Mexico, Denmark, Chile, Japan, Portugal, Spain,
Egypt, and of course China. I have to reintroduce myself to him because he’s spent more time in other countries than he has at home.  He has
some fine memories of the trips and he has brought back many pearls of wisdom.  The pearls that were most precious to me, were the black and
corral pearl necklaces from China.  ( No, I am not above using guilt to get my gifts.)  His memories (and you know the over 50 crowd can’t
remember much) include walking in the Imperial Palace and on the Great Wall of China, swimming in the lagoons of the Mexican Caribbean, learning
about the fine wines of Portugal, living in a monastery in the mountains of northern Spain, reminiscing with old friends and family along the
shores of the Mediterranean, reliving the horrors of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, and most importantly, watching the water go down the toilet
clockwise instead of counter-clockwise in Chile. (He’s an engineer so he notices these things.) Yes, these were business trips.  Do you
sometimes get the impression that you are in the wrong business? Things are going well for Nasr, but he is obsessed with “dislocations.”  Very
few know what this is, so he desperately needs a hobby.  If anyone has any suggestions (NOT TRAVELING) please let him know.</p>
<p>Virginia is now an Assistant Principal. I actually travelled with Nasr this year. The entire family went to Cancun, Mexico, which was pure
relaxation-just what the doctor ordered.  (At least that’s what I told my boss.)  Nasr and I had a second honeymoon in Copenhagen, Denmark.  If
your children visit, make sure they are married and don’t watch the television in the hotels.  I learned some new things from the TV and we’ve
been married for almost 24 years.  Denmark was the first real vacation for me.  My friend took time off to show me around during the day and I
got to do what I wanted.  I didn’t have to mediate between the whims and desires of the children.  (There are some advantages to getting older,
or at least having older children because they can take care of themselves for a short time.)  I saw my mother’s Danish heritage, (tall blonde
and gorgeous), the Viking ships and a most spectacular view of a red sun high in the sky overlooking the deep fiord.  The California Educational
System thinks educators don’t know enough, so I am going back to school again in January to finish Tier II of the Administrative Credential.  I
can’t guarantee that all this training is helping me, but I can guarantee that I am going broke paying for my college, Ami’s college, Adam’s
upcoming college and cars.  We have a new addition to the family.  Frankie is a miniature black lab and loves to love everyone while squirming,
wiggling and groaning.  This is an animal you have to meet to appreciate.  I’m still trying to get Nasr to appreciate him.</p>
<p>Ami (20 on Jan.6) is in her third year at UCLA and is living at home.  Electrical Engineering is a very exciting field, but I feel poor Ami’s
only excitement during the quarter are short trips out to dinner. Each of our children is unique, and one of Ami’s characteristics is that she
cannot wear shoes to an exam. Remember, Ami is an engineer and must feel free to think. She wears sandals to the exams so she can easily remove
them and take the exam barefoot.  One of her professors used his digital camera and sent pictures over the internet of Ami sitting in the front
of the classroom, barefoot and in deep concentration.  For all of us who do not have a 4.0 grade point average, this might be a strategy to help
us.  Or, it may simply be another Ghoniem idiosyncrasy, but do not poo-poo something that works.  She is working very hard and all the hard work
is paying off.  Ami did her summer internship at Hughes Space and Communications.  She loved it and this gave her the opportunity to find out
what happens in industry.  Of course, since she had to commute the long distance to El Segundo during the summer, Ami needed a car.  Her new,
green, 1999 Honda Civic EX helped her travel to work and to San Francisco at the end of the summer.  San Francisco was an eye opener for her.
She discovered that driving the one way streets with steep hills and crazy drivers was a driving experience she does not want to repeat.  She
did enjoy crepes, Golden Gate park where people were dancing on roller blades, and the area called Haight Ashbury.  According to Ami, there are
a lot of fun shops and interesting people.  As I recall, Haight Ashbury  was filled with “fun” shops and “interesting” people in the 1960’s.  It
is scary when your daughter has the same impressions you did, 30 years earlier.</p>
<p>Adam is 17 and is suffering from the dreaded disease “Senioritis.”  Ami had it and it only took three years before Adam was infected.  For those
of you who are lucky enough to have younger children, I will describe “Senioritis.”  It begins with the attitude that “I know it all and you
can’t tell me anything.”  Students infected with the disease do not see any purpose in studying because this is their last year and the only
grades that count are your grades from 10th and 11th grade.  They cannot understand why they need a curfew and a curfew of 12:30 a.m. is
“ridiculous” because EVERYONE else can go home when they want to.  They want to make their own decisions and it doesn’t matter that they are
making the wrong decisions. They don’t need to study for the college entrance exams because it is a “waste of time.”   There are three chances
to take the college entrance exams and there is no reason to take it more than once.  “No matter how hard I study, I won’t do any better!”  is
the usual response.  They believe if you don’t have fun in your senior year, you will never have fun.  They believe a job is more important than
studying for the college entrance exams.  “Who can live on an allowance of $100.00 a month?” is also a common complaint.   I’m hoping that,
like Ami, this disease will be cured by the time he goes to college in the fall.   Adam had been driving my 1986 station wagon and all cars have
a lifetime and this one just couldn’t live through Adam’s senior year.  We cried.   Adam rejoiced!  Adam now drives a new, red, 1999 Honda Civic
DX.  The Ghoniems are single handedly supporting the Honda corporation.   Adam is captain of the volleyball team, but he had to suffer through
Homecoming on crutches.  Some people have glass jaws, Adam has glass ankles.  He only has two ankles and I think he has broken five of them. If
anyone has an immediate cure or prevention of senioritis, please tell me because we will be rich when we market it.</p>
<p>Jasmine is 13 and needs an attitude adjustment on a daily basis.  If it could be done, Jazz would have a phone implanted in her brain, or
cosmetically attached to her ear.  Jazz is on the phone CONSTANTLY!!  If you are trying to contact us and no one answers,  Jazz is on the phone.
If she does pick up the call waiting,  please ask if you can call back and leave a message.  Jazz cannot remember your message because she is
too preoccupied with what she is going to tell her friends next.  If you have called and left a message with Jazz, I am sure I have not
responded.  Please call back and trust the machine, not the 13 year old.  Clothes, clothes and more clothes can be seen scattered across the
room, piled high on her desk, on the floor of her closet, and squished into the hamper. One or two might actually be dirty and need washing.
The remainder have been tried on and discarded as too long, gross, ridiculous, un-cool, or “whatever” and left to stay wherever they have
landed.  I was home ill on a school day and by 2:30, I had witnessed her wearing six different outfits. Jasmine has beautiful curly hair that
she straightens daily.  She cannot understand why Mom will not allow her to use chemicals to straighten and highlight it.  EVERYONE ELSE IN
MIDDLE SCHOOL STRAIGHTENS AND HIGHLIGHTS THEIR HAIR!!  Jasmine gave up going to the art conservatory this year.  I hope she will pick it up
again soon, but I will cherish her artwork that I have displayed in my house.</p>
<p>In March, Mom went to join Daddy and now they are together in a much better place.  This is my first Christmas without Mom and I must say I miss
her a lot. Again, I ask if you meet an intelligent, warm, caring and loving person, just smile, remember Mom, and know there are many wonderful
people in this world and we need to take time to appreciate them because they are the most precious gift we have.</p>
<p>This is the end of a millenium and we need to stop and think about what we’ve accomplished and wonder what is ahead of us.  Let’s pray that
it’ll be special and enlightening.  Have a Merry Christmas and an even Merrier Millenium!</p>
