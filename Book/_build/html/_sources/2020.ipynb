    "For the longest time, I thought I wouldn't write a letter this year. But this is my 35th Christmas letter. My letters have been a history of our family. I've written them in the hope that our children will share them with their children and their grandchildren.\n",
    "However, this letter will be very different from the ones I usually write. With that said, I will begin to muddle through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2020 has not been like any other year in our lives. And I know this year is not like any other for all our friends and family.\n",
    "On December 16, 2019, we tragically lost Adam. Losing a child is a great sadness that cuts deep into the heart. It is almost more than anyone can endure.\n",
    "One blessing that we had, is that so far, we have not been stricken with COVID, as many thousands were across the U.S and the world. I pray for all those families who have dealt with the pain of the sickness and the pain of loss.\n",
    "Adam's wife, Oanh, is a nurse and she was worried that she might bring the virus home from the hospital to her children, so on March 12, 2020, Olivia and Gemma came to live with us. Just like most people we hoped that everything would be better in a couple of months.\n",
    "It wasn't and IT WASN'T!\n",
    "\n",
    "The infection rate of COVID 19 didn't get any better.\n",
    "The terrifying scare was that Oanh got deathly ill. The doctors checked her for COVID, but according to the tests, she didn't have COVID. This wonderful, loving, woman was in the hospital for over a month. It wasn't cancer, but she did receive chemotherapy, six months of recuperation, and now, thank God, she has recovered.\n",
    "It was both sad and wonderful that the children were with us for eight months. It was sad because they desperately missed their mother. Yet it was wonderful, because we got a chance to get even closer to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We miss Amira, Matt, Siena and Jada. It's been a year since we've seen them. Nasr and I haven't and are not taking any chances of getting the virus by boarding a plane. I don't know what we and most of the world would do without Facetime or Zoom. The is one technology that saved the sanity of many across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jasmine has been at home taking care of us. Both her high school and the University require that she teach from home. Again, a blessing in disguise.\n",
    "I am sure that there some cute anecdotes that I could come up with, but this is not the year for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Christmas, we all need to pray for the ones we lost, pray that the vaccines work, and pray we don't lose anyone else from COVID.\n",
    "I can't wish anyone a Merry Christmas or Happy New Year because we all know that it won't be a happy celebration. But I can wish that everyone's 2021 is better than 2020.\n"

    "The holidays are here and thank goodness we can \"sort of' celebrate this year. We can meet in person, but we have to hide our smiles. Of course, we then have to compare the number of vaccines we've endured. Three! I am afraid that by next year I'll be saying five. This year, however, has filled us with a sprinkle of hope, buckets of fear, a rush of tears and dash of fun.\r\n",

    "Nasr retired, but you would never guess it by the number of hours he spends in his office, working on research, helping students finish their PhDs, and having three to four zoom meetings a day. He talks to people all over the world, so he decided to make his meetings feel as real as possible. On the wall of his office, directly in front of his desk, he has a TV monitor that is 49 inches wide --not diagonally but horizontally --measurements are horizontal--so he can see the speaker's head is twice the size of normal. That is not all. On his desk to the right, he has a 29\" wide monitor on which he checks his email, looks a few things up, and can see the rest of the people the Zoom meeting very clearly. Directly in front of Nasr lying at an angle, is another 25\" wide that he can write on-like a whiteboard, but people can see it all over the world. He's not done. He has a choice of using either his 9-inch-wider 4-inch-wide computer to check his notes for his lectures. What else you ask? Nothing! He does not have one piece of paper on his desk.  When you were a kid, would you have left your room if you were surrounded by your favorite toys and could talk to anyone in the world, and get the answers to all your questions in less than a second? Biking is still his absolute joy, but he has graduated to an electric bike. There will be no judgement here from me  and take your bike on the hills around our house and you will understand why electric. Maybe age has a bit to do with it, too. The smile on his face as he feels himself speeding along the Pacific Coast Hwy with giant palm trees on one side of the road and the crashing waves of the ocean on the other with the wind blowing through his hair. Unfortunately, he has to live vicariously through my flowing hair while I am leaving him in the dust a mile away.\r\n",

    "Amira, Matthew, Siena (12), Jada (10)-Dec. 19and Rocko, their Cockapoo dog. The whole family came to visit us at the end of June. The girls got the chance to swim-or shall I say live in the pool. We need to check Jada's DNA. I think she is part mermaid from the Greek Island of Atlantis. We could not get her out of the water. Amira suggested we ALL go to Hawaii in July. We missed each other so much and we needed to get away \"from the pandemic\", which we couldn't, but we tried. Amira found the most spectacular condos in Kanapali in Maui. They were big enough to house all 1O of us, comfortably. All the Koerners  went up to the top of Haleakula to see the sunset over the volcano. Siena wore short shorts and insisted she wasn't cold--everyone else donned winter coats. Twelve-year-olds are hardier than most of us. Both girls learned to snorkel in seconds. We snorkeled at Molokini, but tourism has spoiled the corral there and there weren't as many fish as 28 years ago when we first visited the island. But we didn't need to go anywhere to see fish, there were so many beautiful tropical fish swimming in and around the purple, blue and orange corral right on the beach of our hotel. Siena and I are pen pals. I am learning about Olivia Rodrigo. I was not up on the current singer, but now I know how good she is. Jada loves the camera on her ipad. Well, actually she likes the application that turns her face into weird shapes and adds interesting features to the picture. I am jealous. I have to figure out how to send the same kind of pictures to her. Move over Gidu! Siena has surpassed—some of your mathematical knowledge. Nasr has Pi memorized to 5 digits after the 3.14. He was so proud of himself until Siena recited 27 digits by memory! I think that puts a lot of pressure on Gidu. Amira and Matt are looking for a house, but houses are often taken before they get the chance, or their competitors bid\r\n",

    "Adam, Oanh, Olivia (9) and Gemma (6) Dec. 16\r\n",
    "Adam is always in our hearts and prayers. We miss him, but we all are learning to live with our new normal. Thank goodness, Oanh is well and back to work. YEAH!!!! Olivia and Gemma come here  once a month to spend time with us. These two girls are good at finding things. They discovered a light blue, soft, suede bag, and on one of our trips to the beach they filled it with small rocks. Gidu hopes this is not a foreshadowing of the girl wanting to fill other Tiffany bags with sparkly rocks. Gidu is good at telling girls things that could be considered far-fetched. He wants the girls to use his \"Magic Brush.\" He believes it combs out their hair so much better. But it doesn't actually comb through the hair; it just flattens the hair on top. One morning, Olivia was using Gidu's Magic brush and she excitedly called Gemma into the room. \"It really is magic!\" Now they both use the magic brush. I will let their mom tell them the truth. All three of them loved Hawaii. But please remind Oanh that next time she has to take Dramamine before she gets on a boat. Her face's color matched the floating green kelp. We had to keep her away from it so we could find her. We were worried that Gemmie would not be able to snorkel with us because of her age. She was great, she laid on a special board that has a plastic window so she could see into the water. She got tired of laying there, so she headed to the boat and decided to go down the slide which was up high on the boat. We wanted her to wait until Nasr got there to \"catch\" her. She couldn't wait for her slow-swimming grandfather and slid right into the deep Pacific. Yup, she popped right up like a buoy. She started a trend and then everyone was slipped and sliding into the water. The adults were wmy of the height-I have no idea how Gemma did it. She is a risk taker like her dad. Olivia is a math fact queen. She worked so hard to memorize them through the fun computer games, and of course her mother works with them daily.\r\n",

    "Jasmine bought a house! She struggled with same issues in the housing market as Amira, but somehow, she got lucky andfound this one. She lives in Oceanside about 10 miles from us. Her address is 4757 Sandalwood Way, Oceanside, CA 92057. Her cousin Adam was her realtor, and he made sure she got a good house. Jasmine has discovered a new hobby­ plants. She knows the scientific names of every plant and she knows how to take care of them and propagate them from a stalk. The plants are beautiful. but it's kind of a jungle in her house. Make sure that you bring a small machete when you visit. The two Huskies, Dakota and Juneau are no longer living here-nor are we babysitting them. In case you didn't know, Huskies shed so much hair that you can knit a sweater with the fallen hair every day. Nasr is happy-he does a lot less vacuuming. Jazz is lucky because she has tile floors and the hair doesn't stick to it. The reality of home ownership hit Jazz, so she is now working threejobs. She still teaches Public Health Administration at National University. She teaches grades\r\n",

    "Virginia-provided the comic relief on our Hawaiian trip-but not by choice. People are more buoyant in salt water and some people are very buoyant-like Virginia. I also have an issue with balance. I can get in the water very easily. I have no problem swimming. While swimming just off the hotel beach, Jazz and I saw a huge green sea turtle. I've seen them struggle to get out of the water and onto the sand. Well, I guess I must be a member of the sea turtle family. Getting out of the water was a family affair. Every one of my family members pushed and pulled as they tried to get me out of the water. I would stand up when the water rolled in and when it rolled out, I ended up going backwards and tumbling back into the\r\n",
    "water. So, for good reasons, once I was in the water I stayed there for a long time. At one point, no one was there w help\r\n",
    "because I swam too far north. Yes, you guessed it. I ended up tumbling and rollingonto the sand. A nice young gentleman helped me up. I was mortified. Do not mention this to my family because they will start laughing hysterically. We were so lucky that we could escape for a week and not have to think about problems and just enjoy being with family. We learned the hard way how difficult it is when we cannot be together. We are trying to get back to normal.\r\n",

    "Pumpkin-(See the Picture) -a  miniature Golden Doodle-is the newest member of our family. Doodles don't shed! That is the only reason I got this dog. She is now a little over 5 months. We go for long walks and we visit the Huskies. She even has too much energy for Juneau and Dakota. Pumpkin jumps and nips at their faces, necks and backs. The two older ones get angry and growl, but it doesn't phase Pumpkin one bit. She is oblivious to the havoc she is reeking with those two dogs. Once Pumpkin is in her pen, Juneau and Dakota put their heads on my lap and howl as Huskies do. They are begging me not to bring the brat back.\r\n",

    "As this year wraps up, I pray the vaccines work against the variance Omicron and all the future variants through Zeta. Nasr and I are trying to  decide what names they will give atl_ances once the Greek alphabet runs out.  Learn to count in Greek? I pray that our fears will be allayed, that families can unite again-simply for fun. And I pray that no one else has to die from this horrible virus. The day I saw Gemma jumping upand down on the couch, crying and saying \"I hate the Coronavirus, I hate the Coronavirus\" over and over again made me think. One part of me was jealous because I, too, wanted to jump up and down and shout that I hated it. For a five-year-old, her vocabulary is impressive. I just wish she didn't have to learn and understand that word.\r\n"

    "Nasr enjoyed a lot of admiration from his students and colleagues this year.  The last of his students graduated in May. There was a party with 43 attendees, for his 42nd Ph. D student after teaching for 45 years.  But he wasn’t done celebrating because a symposium was held in his honor at the conference on Multiscale Modeling of Materials (try to say that 5 times fast) in Baltimore. Over the past 45 years he has taught some very intelligent people working in high places, and they showed up to pay tribute to Nasr.  The symposium was supposed to have taken place in 2020 when he “officially retired”, but Covid had other plans. As soon as the last student wore his cap and gown, Nasr stopped spending ALL DAY in his office.  Nasr took on a second career—gardener/construction worker.  The summer was super-hot, but he insisted on wearing his long sleeve coveralls made of dark blue, heavy denim to keep his clothes clean.  Nasr binged on You Tube to learn how to do all the projects he wanted to do.  He bought a spray paint machine and learned how to spray paint.  He now can lay tile on floors and walls, and he does all sorts of landscaping.  Nasr has been living in YouTube nirvana. This fall he hired a contractor to paint the inside of the house. ARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH.  My suggestion is not to do the whole house at once—especially just a few weeks before Thanksgiving. He also had new ceiling lights installed in most rooms.  These are not ordinary lights—you need a Ph.D. to set them up and use them.  Using the app, you change the brightness, and the color of each lamp.  These devices even flash dance to music, no, I am not kidding. Don’t worry, by the New Year he will be back sitting at his desk for hours—the siren song from the computer has started calling him already.  \n",

    "Virginia attended her 50th High School Reunion.  Dang it!  How did 50 years go by so fast.  Things are constantly changing but boy, has De Pere, Wisconsin, changed. It now has a cultural center that plans to rival the best arts centers in the states.   De Pere?  Yup! They cleaned the Fox River from the pollution of the 70’s, so for the first time, I cruised the Fox, and surprisingly it flows north just like the Nile.  There are many MANSIONS—not big houses, but honest goodness mansions, on the banks.  Our high school is now an intermediate school that houses 4th and 5th graders.  The principal is very young, (maybe 5!!) but he did a great job of showing us the changes in the building. But the one thing that hasn’t changed is how wonderful us “kids” (pushing 70) have remained.  People in Wisconsin are fun, but I think my class of 1972 has the most warm-hearted people in the world. I’m still writing—cross your fingers—I don’t want to jinx it.  Also, I have gone back to playing the piano.  I am learning to play like the pianists in lounges. I use chords for the left hand and play a simple melody with the right hand.  In the last two months, I’ve tickled the ivories more than I have in the last 50 years.  I don’t keep Nasr awake at night because his ear buds block out any outside noise.  At least that is what he wants me to believe, otherwise it’s his reason for ignoring me.  What do you think?  Guess who oversaw Grandma Camp this summer.  We had all four granddaughters for a month.  It was wonderful and Nasr and I slept well all month.  I am blessed with well behaved grandkids that have a lot of energy.  Surprisingly the month flew by. We went to the beach, had a lot of fun in the pool, ate gelato, hiked, ate gelato, swam in the ocean, ate gelato, surfed, ate gelato, did goat yoga, ate gelato and they even did daily, summer homework.\n",

    "Amira, Matthew, Siena, and Jada bought a new house—then they tore it down and are building a new one in its place—but this one will be much bigger and prettier.  That is what they do on the “Other Coast.”  Amira planned a wonderful family trip to Boston and then onto Maine for ALL of us. We all ate so much lobster that we will have no problem waiting until next summer to indulge again. But we did get a chance to hold a lobster on our lobster cruise.   Siena and Jada were not born under the zodiac water signs, but they should have been.  While visiting us, Jada got up in the morning, did her homework and stayed almost all day in the pool.  Siena took surfing lessons and was in the pool almost much as Jada.  Siena, as of August, is a teenager. Does that tell you anything? Nasr tutors her in math, just like he tutored so many kids in the neighborhood.  But instead of using the white board and sitting in the nook, he was teaching via zoom.   A few weeks ago, Siena, with her school chorus, sang with the Marine band in the famous Wolf Trap Amphitheatre outside of Washington D.C. Jada spends a lot of time in another world—the virtual world. She puts on a special head piece that covers her eyes.  Then you will find her in the middle of the family room, jumping, and grabbing for things that are not there in our world. It’s very weird to watch. She is also a great athlete. Her traveling soccer team won their last tournament—I guess the swimming was good for her stamina. She is also taking trombone lessons with the school band. Jada is the slime queen.  I think she could be in the Guinness Book of World Records for the amount of homemade slime she has created.   Both girls are winners. At their neighborhood Halloween festival, they and their two friends won 2nd Place in the Chili Cook Off Competition.  They were the only kids who participated, and all entries were anonymous.  Siena said they used a traditional recipe, but they were fighting all the while they were cooking.  I told her maybe the fight energy made the chili taste better.\n",

    "Oanh, Olivia, Gemma, were busy this year. During Grandma Camp they really had fun playing with their cousins.  Olivia and Jada are just a year apart so that was easy, but Siena and Gemma are six and a half years apart.  Gemma thinks that is the best—if she had her druthers she would be glued to Siena.  You all have to praise Siena because she pretty willingly spent time with Gemma, and deep down I know she had fun. Olivia loves to create whatever she can using arts and crafts.  She knows how to make homemade stickers, beaded lizards, and origami everything.  Gemma can spend her day painting, creating sculptures with clay and dancing.  She is usually dancing to whatever is on the tv.  She doesn’t watch, she wants us to watch her dance. When we are out walking, she behaves like she is in the movie, Singing in the Rain, hopping on the curbs, twirling on benches and jumping into our arms. Olivia, like her dad loves to talk, but she takes it to a different level—our ears are ringing by the time she goes to bed.  These two children are very wise.  One day Nasr bought some noise makers for Gemma. Olivia came up to me and said, “Teta, Gidu just sent you on a trip to headache land with that toy.”  And she did!  Both girls are concerned about my health. Gemma told me, “Teta you are a little rusty like a rusty car, but you will live a long time. Right?” Then she added, “You have a lot of wrinkles,” then she squeezes her cheeks under her eyes and adds, “But, you are still pretty.” Olivia saves her wish bones.  She is always wishing for her daddy, Adam, to come back.  She doesn’t want to chance not getting her wish, so she doesn’t break them. I started saving mine, too.\n",

    "Jasmine (A Tiger) is very busy.  She is teaching full time at Audeo 3, a secondary Charter school, and teaches Public Health Administration at National University for abouts 10 months a year. She also reviews applications for UC San Diego admissions. This December she is finishing her last class for her Clear Teaching Credential. She goes on 5-mile-long hikes with her dogs.  She wants me to come with her, but she walks too fast going uphill, and the only way I will keep up with her going downhill is to roll down.  So, I pass on that activity. Even though she has a lot going on, she was able to go to Maine with us.  It is so much fun watching our two girls laugh and tease each other. At the end of the Maine and DC trip we went to Wisconsin for her cousin, Lucy’s, wedding reception.  While we were there, my cousin, Mark, took Jasmine, Nasr and I on a field trip through my 10-acre woods.  He has this amazing little truck that goes everywhere—even places that are kind of scary-like the edge of the cliffs.  But this gave Jazz the bug for the woodlands and outdoors life of Wisconsin.  She came back and wanted to buy the land from me, immediately.  She thinks she can live there.  I laughed.  I told her she had to live five months in a Wisconsin winter before I would even consider selling.  Would someone please tell my daughter—a confirmed California Valley Girl—that she will freeze in Wisconsin. It is not sunny, warm California!\n",

    "Nasr is reinventing himself.  He is still working at UCLA and consulting for three companies, so he is in his office for most of the week.  For years I have tried to get Nasr to find a hobby.  All work and no play make Nasr a dull boy.  He celebrated his 75th birthday and he finally has found a hobby or two or three. He discovered Epoxy—ok, I had no clue what that was either, just know that it is a sticky gluey substance, that can have various colors added to it. It hardens and makes the surface of whatever you are working on very durable.  His first project was to create an ocean scene on his garage workbench. Very pretty! Come on guys—I bet you want one like that, too. He discovered that he likes playing with sticky colorful stuff so much that he bought a handheld paint sprayer and painted the garden gate. That was successful so he was on to bigger jobs.  He bought a top of the line, industrial paint sprayer. After watching hundreds of YouTube videos, he has decided he can be an expert in everything he decides to do, if YouTube has a video of it. Jasmine wanted to remove the black paint from her kitchen island, so Nasr took over the job.  He bought all kinds of timber, an industrial sander, and a painting tent.  He is going to use that on Jasmine’s kitchen cabinets.  I will let you know how that turns out.  \n",

    "Virginia-- Nasr and I went on a trip of a lifetime.  Even though we’ve been to Egypt many times, this trip was a first-class adventure. Our dear friends, Semra and Sam traveled with us. We started in Cairo and visited the new Museum of Ancient Civilizations-this is a cliff notes version of the Grand Egyptian Museum.  But the one we saw had the mummies of Royal Kings and Queens. The first time I was on the Giza plateau I was 22 years old—you know 5 years ago. At that time, I climbed the inner tunnel and gallery up to the Kings sarcophagus with ease.  When we went in 1977, there wasn’t as much interest in the pyramids so there were no crowds.   Well, things have changed in 2023. When we decided to climb up the pyramid, we didn’t stop to think that were going to go up 250 feet from where we started.  No elevators, only 5 to 7 feet steps. The most difficult part of ascending was walking through the 40–50-foot narrow tunnel that has you walking up bent over from the waist.  Yes, that was a workout. Now there are crowds—lots of people going up a tiny tunnel and then into the gallery hall that leads up to the Kings Chamber.  There are no windows and no ventilation.  Yes, it was HOT. We got our pictures by the sarcophagus, and then we headed down.  Ok, it wasn’t 5 years ago, it was closer to 50 years since I climbed up.  I got down from the huge gallery.  But once we hit the narrow tunnel, my knees and legs gave out.  Yup! I scooted down the tunnel on my butt. Nasr, Sam and Semra got down on two feet, not two cheeks. There were a lot of people from all over the world cheering for me…or laughing at me. I will choose cheering. In the future, I will leave the pyramid climbing to the younger people. We flew south to Abu Simbel.  These statues are the size of a mountain. Our accommodations in Aswan were the Old Cataract Hotel, where Agatha Christie wrote Death on the Nile. This is a luxurious hotel.  Then we boarded the ship for the Cruise north.  The food was wonderful.  The historical tours we took were beyond imagination and we relaxed completely.  Nope, we aren’t done yet with the vacation. We then spent a week in Sharm El Sheik on the Sinai Pennisula in the Four Seasons Hotel.  Nasr keeps asking me what I want for Christmas—I think he gave it to me in March. \n",

    "Amira, Matt, Siena, and Jada built a 5500 square foot house.  The builder wanted to make it bigger, but they ran out of land to build on. The three floors have so much light and space.  We visited Amira at Thanksgiving. I can’t believe how much decorating they have accomplished in only a few months. On top of working full time, they did a lot of traveling this year.  The whole family came to San Diego.  That was partly Grandma Camp. Amira had a girls’ weekend in Santa Barbara, and the whole family went to Disney World in November. According to the Koerners, It’s A Small World there is not as good as the one in California. Siena is very proud; she is taller than Jasmine and she is still the clone of her mother.  Jada is almost as tall as Jazz.  I think Jada grew five inches over the summer.  There is such a thing as growing pains.  Just ask Jada, she was in agony for 6 months. I am sure Matt is related to Tom Sawyer.  Nasr must constantly be doing something, or he gets grumpy, so he asked Matt if there was something he could help with around the house.  Matt decided he could stain his wood fence.  He just had to “glop it on.”  So, Matt, aka Tom Sawyer, convinced Nasr that painting the fence would be fun. Nasr wasn’t going to do all the work alone, so he roped me in, telling me it would be fun. Matt got the both of us to paint his 145-foot fence in one day. We wore white painters’ overalls with tight hoods. My white tennis shoes took a beating. I left them there because next time we go we must paint the other side in the neighbor’s yard. Jasmine said we looked like garden gnomes. (If you have read Mark Twain’s book, Tom Sawyer, you will get the reference.\n",

I think these two women are convinced that their 12-hour shifts at the hospital are easier than the 12-hour shift with the twins.  Olivia has learned to change a diaper, can pick up the babies and feed them. So, Olivia is a big help when she is not in school.  Gemma’s job is to entertain them and make sure they don’t crawl where they shouldn’t. Both girls are shining stars in school.  I think Gidu encouraged them by enrolling them in IXL.  This is an online education program that is fun for the girls.  IXL sends Nasr progress reports.  Don’t tell the girls, but I think Nasr has big plans for them, meaning he wants them to be engineers. We are giving them a chance to see plays at the theatre—Tarzan and Grinch! The only problem is that we don’t get to see them enough. Between our travels and life in general, it is hard to get together.  We try once a month.  This holiday we will spend almost a month with them.  Yipppeee!\n",

    "Jasmine (Drum roll) and Tommy Pippin are engaged! Tommy is an intelligent, resourceful, and kind man.  Oh, it also helps that he is very handsome. We have never seen Jasmine so happy. She is very excited to marry the man of her dreams.  She says she looks forward to a wonderful life together with Tommy. Her Uncle Gamal and Aunt Magda hosted a beautiful engagement party at their country club in San Juan Capistrano last April. It was such a wonderful affair that people said that the engagement party should have been their wedding.  Nope. They don’t know Jazz.  Their wedding will be on April 21, 2024.  So, Jasmine and I have been very busy planning and finding vendors for the occasion.  Do you realize how many vendors you need for a wedding—more than I count! At this point, I think no one wonders why Nasr hasn’t really retired yet. My bridal planning skills are a little rusty. I haven’t used them since Amira and Matt were married in 2004—yup 20 years ago. At Thanksgiving, when we were with Amira and Matt, Jazz got the chance to show Tommy the spectacular monuments, (there is still a lot more for him to see next time), George Washington University where she attended, and the best for Tommy was the Steven Udar-Hazy Air Museum. His favorites were the SR71 Blackbird and the Discovery Space Shuttle.   Jazzy is still teaching but hopes to find a teaching job in which she can work from home. \n",
    "Hopefully, next year we can take the whole family to Egypt and give them a chance to see some of their ancestral history. We are cruel parents and grandparents, but we are not going first class next year.  We are looking forward to a good year and bringing Tommy into our family. (Make sure you don’t warn him ahead of time.)\n",

    "We wish everyone a happy, healthy, and peace-filled New Year.\n"

    "Nasr broke the bank this year.  Believe me, he was scrounging among the many pieces of his piggy bank to get to the last penny. Jasmine and Tommy got married on April 21, 2024! He gave them a fairy tale wedding.  (KA-CHING),  Jasmine’s taste runs high—just like Princess Jasmine—except Nasr didn’t have the blue genie giving him bags of gold.  Then two months later, he took the family on a two-week family vacation to Egypt.  (KA-CHING).  Our family is no longer merely 5 people, it has expanded to 11.  Our kids have visited Egypt before, but their memories have faded and none of the grandchildren have been there, nor have Oanh or Tommy. A private tour, complete with 16 passenger van, driver, manager, tour guide and security guard is not how we usually travel, but we wanted to show them the best of Egypt. (KA-CHING).   We only saw part of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM).  The huge red granite statue of Ramses II stands in the entrance. He is over 30 feet tall and weighs 83 tons, yeah-he IS a big guy. Nasr gathered all of us around him and said, “Kids, this is your great, great, great grandpa.  He didn’t say that it was their great 133 times grandpa.  Nasr does he himself as coming from royalty, but I think most Egyptian people have a bit of Ramses II in them.  Later when the grandkids saw the mummy of Ramses II, they very politely said, “Hi Grandpa.”  You can’t go to Egypt without a camel ride at the Pyramids.  Well, at least, we can’t. The grandkids didn’t expect that when the camel stands, his backside comes up first and you lean forward at 45-degree angle and you feel as if you are going to take a nosedive into the hot Saharan sand, so you hang on for dear life. Siena didn’t used to like horses, so the camels petrified her.  She started to cry the minute she got on his back.  Tommy doesn’t like horses either, but he held it together well.  Gemma and Olivia jumped on these creatures, put their hands in the air and said, “Look Mom, no hands!” As we caravaned on the camels, Nasr, the descendent of the pharaoh rode in a red canopied chariot next to us.   Should I mention it was being pulled by a donkey? We picked the hottest day (102 degrees) for our visit to the Pyramids. The Ghoniem tribe, minus Gidu and Teta, climbed UP the 250-foot windowless tunnel.  Yes, they came out looking like they had taken a shower.  Once we returned from Egypt, Nasr kept breaking more piggy banks because in September we visited Croatia with our dear friends, Sam and Semra.  In the city of Split—yes, just like it looks—there is a 28-foot bronze statue of St. Gregory of Nin.  (Nasr s happy he was shorter than Ramses.) He is best known for advocating for church services to be in the language of the people. His bare feet are huge and very lifelike.  He has a large big toe that has a shiny brass sheen.  This is an overworked toe because the belief is that if you rub this toe, your wishes will come true.  Nasr and I were rubbing it like crazy.  No, we weren’t done traveling.  We flew to Viena to visit a long time friend and Nasr treated us to stay in the Hotel Imperial. (KA-CHING). The original building was built by royalty, so it has huge chandeliers in every room, even the bathrooms. Nasr was pleased that he splurged on the hotel for us, but then his fun was deflated when he learned Amira had stayed there several years before.  Nasr has glued his piggy banks back together. He is still doing research at UCLA, consulting, and teaching a renewable energy class.  Clink, Clink, Clink, the piggy banks are being refilled.  Who knows when we will have to open them again?  Christmas is here, but Nasr is guarding those banks with his life. \n",

    "Virginia spent most of the year planning and planning for Jasmine’s wedding.  I didn’t have to slide down the Pyramid this year, because I was smart enough not to tackle it again.  However, as we were leaving the GEM, there are dome-shaped caps covering something on the floor—I am thinking holes to hold the Disneyland type poles.  Well, if there is something on the floor, rest assured, my feet will find it. And I did! I tripped over one and went flying.  Nasr told me he was impressed by the way I fell; he said I was like a stunt woman because I twisted and rolled.  Did I do that consciously, nope.  I think survival mode kicked in. Surprisingly, I only had a few bumps and bruises on my knees and hands.  Tommy was shocked that I was riding a camel an hour later.  The truth is I am not going to let anything get in the way of my fun.\n",

    "Amira and Matthew had to hightail it out of Egypt because two days after they returned home, the girls were at a two-week camp. Their favorite activities we water skiing, wakeboarding and riding the banana boat—but the purpose of that boat is only to make sure you don’t stay on it.  Amira and Matt celebrated their 20th Anniversary this September.  Amira, as Jasmine’s maid of honor, planned a bachelorette in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in the Sonoran Desert.  I guess if there is a desert, there must be camels, so Amira, Jasmine and friends rode very large camels, enjoyed the sunsets, the water and a few drinks.  They said it was only a few.  Matt and Amira took the whole family to Portugal during spring break. They loved all the sightseeing, but the most impressive—especially for Jada and Siena—was Nazare Beach.  This is a surfer’s paradise with 100-foot waves.  Siena is dreaming of surfing there, but mom and dad put the kibosh on that.  Jada is our chef and their favorite dessert in Portugal was Pasteis de Nata, an egg custard tart.  Jada needs to know that the next time we visit, she is making this dessert for me.  At their annual Fall Chili Cookoff, Jada and Siena got first prize again.  No matter how much Teta begs, I can’t get them to tell me the recipe. Jada is in 7th grade, and the poor child needs to be at school by 7:20 a.m. I think I read that it is illegal for teenagers to go to school that early. Jada is a soccer star and is getting more and more confident. Siena at 15, is a freshman in high school and is working very hard. She loves math and science.  Gidu is giddy with glee, so he thinks she may be a budding engineer. Someone tell Gidu to stand down, let her decide.  Siena plays field hockey and runs track.  Even though her meets are indoors, the outside weather is 20 degrees, and she is running in shorts and a tank top.  She, like her mom and dad, are driven to run.  Some of us can only run to the bathroom.\n",

    "Oanh, Olivia and Gemma—Olivia is turning 12 in February and Gemma will be 9 before you get this letter.  They travelled the longest with us in Egypt—we were together for almost three weeks. Once their cousins went home, we moved to a different hotel.  The girls loved the local grocery store and went there as soon as they were finished with breakfast and right before bed.  They discovered the Egyptian candy and the pomegranate Schweppes drinks.  Oanh managed to carry about two dozen cans home in her suitcase.  The reason being is that you can’t find that flavor in the states.   When we were packing to leave, and at first, her suitcase weighed 100 pounds.  But she found a way to distribute all the stuff in it.  I didn’t lift her backpack, but I am sure it was very heavy--at least 45 pounds--but no liquids.  When Oahn travels her backpack is like a magician’s hat. She pulled out I don’t know how many bowls of udon soup for the girls on the plane. She also can pull out all sorts of over-the-counter medicine for the whole group—some of us got King Tut’s Revenge. None of us are traveling without Oanh or without consulting her about what medicines to bring.  For a while I thought she was the real Mary Poppins and was going to start bringing chairs out of it.  Olivia received a certificate for solving 4000 math problems on IXL (a computer learning program that Nasr found for them. It is not only for math, but for science and reading.  After returning from Egypt we stayed with Amira and Olivia and Gemma got a chance to see the monuments and the museums in Washington D.C. Surprisingly, I found we can go ice skating in Carlsbad. The girls want to go every weekend that they are here—thank goodness Tommy and Jazzy took them the first time.  They bounce when they fall, Gidu and I break.  Olivia has a specific amount of time that she can watch her shows on her tablet.  I don’t know if Olivia is a speed reader, but she is a speed listener!  She watches all her shows at two times the regular speed—this way she can watch more shows. Gemma sees Tommy as a Jungle Gym.  She loves to climb on him and have him hold her upside down. Thank you, Tommy, for all your patience.  Gemma, in third grade, reads at a 6th grade level, and Olivia reads at an 11th grade level as a 6th grader.  She has read the whole Hunger Games series.\n",

    "JASMINE AND TOMMY’s wedding was on APRIL 21, 2024.  She was beautiful and he was handsome.  It really was exactly how Jasmine pictured it. Everything turned out exactly as we planned it—maybe even better. (Thank you, Dad). All our friends and family were there to celebrate with us. The couple paraded into the ballroom behind the Egyptian wedding procession called the Zeffa, complete with belly dancers, drummers, and sword dancers.  I looked around and the entire room was smiling and clapping as they watched the procession.  It was a year of planning and 8 hours of partying.  Jasmine now is teaching in Carlsbad, yes close enough so we can have lunch together.  Tommy is still surveying.  He may grumble about the early hours, but I can tell he loves his job.  This lovely couple stayed with us in Cairo and Alexandria, but they split from us and went to Greece for their honeymoon.  In Athens, they were surprised that the Greek artifacts were better preserved in Egypt than in Greece.  However, they loved the islands of Mykonos and Santorini. They rode a catamaran on the blue Aegean Sea, had sunset massages on their balconies, and rode ATV’s around the islands.  They dined at a restaurant where they could throw and break their plates.  Their honeymoon was romantic, fruitful and fun.  \n",
