    "Greetings from the Ghoniems    \n",
    "\n",
    "MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL! \"  ... I apologize in advance to all the people who hate getting this kind of Christmas letter.  Every Christmas is a\n",
    "busy time of year, but as of yet, I haven't adjusted to the changes in our family life.  Give me another 18 years and I should have it down pat.\n",
    "So, as I was saying, any of you who can't stand to read this, stop right now and give us a call.  I promise to give you a very personal\n",
    "rendition of what has been happening to us over the past year.  The number is (818) 891-1616.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for all you die-hards who are willing to put up with this kind of letter, or for those of you who actually enjoy them, I will continue. The\n",
    "biggest news about the Ghoniems is that we have expanded.  I suffered all through 1986 (not too silently either, just ask Nasr) in order that we\n",
    "could have our third and LAST child. (Yes, you may quote me on that).  Jasmine Suzanne Ghoniem was born on August 29, 1986 at 11:46p.m. She came\n",
    "into the world at night and that is the time of day she loves best.   She weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces at birth, and now has topped the scales at\n",
    "over 13 pounds.  She is growing fast and takes after her mother, she doesn't suffer in silence. I think Jasmine may be our only blue eyed baby,\n",
    "finally one of the kids took something from Mom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is four years old and is not adjusting very well to having a baby sister.  He spends the majority of the day trying to twist his hand\n",
    "around her head as if he were trying to juice it like an orange. To say the least, Adam and I are having quite a few arguments over the proper\n",
    "way to touch the baby, and I'm losing all of them.  Adam started pre-school this year and goes three days a week.  He enjoys it and it gives him\n",
    "some socialization with other children, and besides all those good things, it gives Jasmine's head a rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amira is six, about to be seven, but going on thirty.  She is doing very well in first grade.  She has been accepted into the gifted program.\n",
    "Now all these talents come from someone, and depending on whether you ask Nasr or me, will determine whether you hear it comes from my side of\n",
    "the family or his.  But since I'm writing this letter, it comes from the Schink side of the family.  Amira is an excellent baby-sitter.  Once\n",
    "she finishes her homework, I simply drop Jasmine into her lap and then proceed to do everything I should have done during the day in\n",
    "approximately one hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia, still young enough to admit she's only a mere 32.  Look, what do I have to worry about, I'm the fifth out of six.  It's my siblings\n",
    "that cringe when I give my age because everyone knows they're lots older than me.  (How many of you think I'm going to get four very nasty\n",
    "letters from my siblings? At least that's one way to get them to write to me.)  To say the least, I've been very busy with the three kids.  I\n",
    "spend the majority of my day chauffeuring kids to and from school, settling fights, helping with homework, nursing and changing babies.  My\n",
    "writing is sort of by the wayside until Jasmine is a little older and I'm more organized.  We are in the process of remodelling the house, and I\n",
    "must admit, IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!  We made the mistake of having a child at the same time as we remodelled.  Learn from someone who knows,\n",
    "either have a child or remodel, don't do both!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr, who will really be 39 in January , and I'm sure he'll stay that age forever, has also had a busy year.    He's had several opportunities\n",
    "to move, but found UCLA really is the best for him.  He became a full professor in July and now theoretically, he could sit back on his laurels\n",
    "and relax, but that's not in Nasr's nature.  He has his hands in more pies than ever now and he almost has me convinced that he likes what he's\n",
    "doing.  But then again, our trip to Lake Tahoe showed him how good the life of leisure really is.  He faltered a little in the summer, but now\n",
    "he's back full swing and working long, hard hours.  Nasr, who loves large families, is definitely convinced that our family is large enough. The\n",
    "noise level in the house is deafening and most days, he would like to escape to a quiet place (for that matter so would I), but he's a very good\n",
    "daddy who spends lots of time with all three kids, and no, he hasn't forgotten how to change a diaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our year has been filled with joy, happiness, and new beginnings. It is our fondest wish that all of our friends and relatives have a very Merry\n",

    "Again, I'm apologizing in advance for a typed letter. I wish I had the time to write a letter this long to everyone, but as there are so many\n",
    "people I want to share our lives with, it is totally impossible to be completely personal. I'd have to start in July to finish by December, and\n",
    "then what I'd written in July would be old hat, so I'd have to rewrite, but there' d be no time so...AAAAAHHHHH...a vicious circle. Therefore\n",

    "NASR has had a full, busy year. He has adopted a new schedule. He leaves at 6:30 in the morning and comes home at 7:30 in the evening. He uses\n",
    "the excuse that the LA traffic has gotten so horrific that if he doesn't leave early and return late, he'll spend four hours commuting only 16\n",
    "miles. You can believe that if you want to, but as you read on, you may come to a different conclusion. Nasr also spent five, lovely,\n",
    "fun-filled, stimulating yet relaxing weeks in Europe and Egypt. He spent two weeks in the French Alps, hiking and sightseeing. He says he went\n",
    "there for a workshop. He then spent two weeks relaxing with his family in Egypt, swimming in the Mediterranean, taking walks along the Nile and\n",
    "enjoying his family's company. He spent the last week of his trip in southern Germany, meeting old friends, sightseeing in the museums and the\n",
    "zoo and shopping. Of course, I won't complain all that much about the shopping as he was shopping for me and the kids. Again, this was a\n",

    "VIRGINIA, while Nasr spent his time in Europe spent five, 1-o-n-g, lonely, frustrating, exasperating, and earthshaking (we had two earthquakes\n",
    "while he was gone) weeks in Los Angeles with three very active children. (That's too long a story to relate here.) As a family, however, we did\n",
    "take a wonderful vacation in Wisconsin this summer. I got a chance to see my high school friends at our own personal 15 year reunion. (I\n",
    "graduated when I was 6). It's nice to know that time doesn't change what's deep inside a person, even though the mirror tells us differently and\n",
    "our kids nearly bust themselves trying not to laugh at our high school pictures. I also had the honor of organizing the family ancestral photos.\n",
    "Sounds impressive? Actually, Mom had several boxes filled, helter skelter with pictures of total strangers, or so I thought. These pictures were\n",
    "of family, grandparents, cousins and friends. Poor Mom, I think she regretted letting me do the job because I wasn't content with just pasting\n",
    "them into the book. I wanted to know who all those people were and how they were related to me. I know I taxed her memory and we spent lots of\n",
    "hours on it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I regret is that I couldn't find a picture of Daddy as a young man dressed in something\n",
    "other than overalls. I'm sure such a picture exists and my next crusade is to find a picture of Daddy, with hair and dressed in a suit. When I'm\n",
    "not vacationing, I'm busy writing. I'm determined that someday I'll publish a book. So, hang onto this letter. It is an original Virginia\n",

    "AMIRA, 7, is doing well in third grade. I admit I was a little worried about having her skip second grade, but it hasn't affected her at all,\n",
    "and she even was citizen of the month in November. Amira is not content with mere studies. She needs other activities to keep her busy and not\n",
    "bored. In ballet, she is doing beautifully. She is graceful and elegant, and can move her body in ways that Mom can only dream about doing. She\n",
    "gave a piano recital at the beginning of November. She played Beethoven's \"Fur Elise\" and she did it wonderfully. She was very poised and calm\n",
    "while playing on the Grand piano. Her one little quirk is that she loves to read while standing on her head and practicing her gymnastics. She\n",
    "got the love of reading from her mother, but I assure you, that the standing on the head part must have come from Dad.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM,5, is no longer juicing Jasmine's head, but he has devised new devious ways of irritating her and getting some negative attention. Jasmine\n",
    "will \"accidentally\" fall according to Adam. But, mother's trained eye has seen him stick his foot out and trip the teetering toddler. And of\n",
    "course, he thinks a simple \"I'm sorry\" is going to forgive all his sins. He is seriously thinking of making a tape that only says \"I'm sorry\" on\n",
    "it. He'll keep it on all the time so then he won't have to be bothered with unimportant apologies that have no meaning to him. Yes, he's smart\n",
    "and he's doing very well in kindergarten, too. He wishes he could spend all day in school. (Should I say it? No, you understand.) Adam, in\n",
    "school, is a wonderfully behaved boy. He got the first Good Citizenship award in his class. Summer vacation at Grandma and Grandpa's was most\n",
    "memorable for Adam. He loved helping Grandpa feed the cows in the barnyard. Adam, when he is excited, talks and walks, and doesn't watch where\n",
    "he puts his feet. Yes, you're right. He backed right off the wagon and landed in a pile of manure. Adam popped up sputtering and accusing\n",

    "bright, shining, blue eyes and a head of curly, blonde hair. But somewhere, way, way back, one of her ancestors must have made a wrong turn in\n",
    "the evolutionary chain. (Of course, I'm not naming names, but we know who grew up on the African continent, don't we.) Believe me, I'm not\n",
    "making rash statements, I can back up my claims. I will put Jasmine in the family room and walk into the kitchen. By the time I turn around to\n",
    "glance at her, she's standing in the middle of the table reaching for the chandelier, just wishing she was an inch or two taller so she can\n",
    "swing on it. And, if she's not on the table, then she's standing on top of the television or doing a balancing act on the fireplace or running\n",
    "across the back of the couch. Feeding time is strenuous exercise. She doesn't sit calmly in her high chair. (Don't tell me to tie her in because\n",
    "she can get out of places that would have baffled Houdini!) She'll sit calmly in the high chair for 30 seconds and then stands up and starts\n",
    "doing deep knee bends while I'm trying to stuff food into her mouth. She's a smart monkey, too. As soon as Adam comes near her, she lets out a\n",
    "warning screech that would rival any of those primates in the zoo. Adam, then walks up to me and says, \"I don't think Jasmine likes me. What do\n",
    "you think?\" Should I lie? 1987 has been filled with a wide variety of happenings and lots of happiness. I can say it now because those antics\n",
    "are in the past and I thank God I'm not a psychic because I don't want to know what the kids have in store for me in the future.\n",
