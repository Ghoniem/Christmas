    "Adam is 18 and is a freshman at the University of California at Santa Barbara .  He is staying in a dorm that overlooks the Pacific Ocean.  If you have been reading these letters over the years, you will recall that Nasr spent a sabbatical in Santa Barbara.  The view, according to Adam, hasn't changed.  The beaches are still filled with bikini-clad bodies and muscled surfers in wet suits.  Yes, Adam is really studying.  He is studying to be an Electrical Engineer.  (I think there is an echo from a previous child, and a little pressure from Dad.)  If you recall, in my last letter I spoke of the Adam's dreaded disease--senior-itis.  If I gave you the impression that the disease was bad in December, let me tell you, by June is was ALMOST incurable.  I received a phone call two days before graduation that Adam may not graduate because he didn't like to attend art class! (Of course, Nasr was in Washington D.C at the time.)  I don't know who suffered more from the disease, Mom or Adam.  It turned out that he made the number of classes that he is allowed to miss by only one!  He did graduate and now he is doing very well in Santa Barbara.  All the words of encouragement that we gave him finally sunk in.  Or maybe it was someone who has more influence on him told him he could get straight A's.  He's on his way to getting them.  He got a 100% and a 90% on two chemistry midterms.  He finds chemistry easy.  Now he realizes that school is really not that hard if you open a book, read it and listen to the professors lecture.  (Isn't that an amazing concept?) Adam is doing so well in chemistry that he decided to work on his own chemistry project.  He and a friend were hungry for brownies.  It was a seven hour process that included a one hour hike to the store, 10 extra eggs, a mixing bowl that was actually a zip lock bag that could handle excessive squishing, and microwave baking because no real oven could be found.   Adam's chemistry experiment yielded brownies that were burned in the center, because the microwave bakes inside out.  But, they were the best brownies he ever tasted.\n",

    "Greetings from the Ghoniems!\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a year filled with worries and wonder.  Things are back to normal  or as normal as it can get in the \n",
    "Ghoniem household.  Many things have happened and I  ll try to bring you up-to-date. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr had a year of great highs and great lows.  Unfortunately, two days into the year, Nasr lost his mother.  This \n",
    "was a horrible way to begin the year, but his parents have been watching over him to make sure his year turned out great. \n",
    "They really had to watch over him carefully when he was remodeling the house.  Sometimes my dear sweet husband is \n",
    "penny wise and pound foolish. As part of fixing up the house, he needed to trim the trees hanging over the gazebo and in \n",
    "various other parts of the yard.  In his   wisdom   he purchased a chain saw. (Now to most Americans, just the thought of a \n",
    "chain saw fills them with horror.) When Nasr told Adam he was planning to use the chain saw and save \\$1500, Adam \n",
    "begged me to convince his dad not to go ahead with his plan.  (Remember, Adam was in Iraq, worried about his father  \n",
    "rather than worrying about the dangers there.) Nasr decided to use the saw himself rather than have the YOUNG and \n",
    "STRONG workers use it. Yes, thanks to their watchfulness, he safely trimmed the 10 trees in the yard.  However, no \n",
    "parent saves their children from danger without a little punishment for their actions.  Therefore, Nasr ended up with such \n",
    "severe shoulder pain from the trimming that the $1500 he saved on not hiring someone to trim, he paid to the chiropractor \n",
    "to alleviate the pain! Nasr has earned the title   Distinguished   Professor at UCLA.  Yes, it is a great title, but as with most \n",
    "great titles, no money is attached.  He was also elected as a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  \n",
    "This is a great honor! (You  re right  no money!) After 8 years of hard labor and collaboration with Daniel Walgraef, \n",
    "Nasr completed two books. (1 book 2 volumes and 1100 pages.) Everyone thinks Nasr is the quiet one, but he  s the wordy \n",
    "one in this very lengthy masterpiece.  Now I challenge all our friends to go out purchase this book and try to make sense \n",

    "longer covers my grey because worry totally changed my hair color. (If you think I was bad, Nasr was worse  at least \n",
    "now he has an excuse for his hair loss.) While Adam was away there were not many times to have fun, but I did attend a \n",
    "conference at Universal Studios and I had the chance to walk the RED CARPET.  Yes, I do have pictures and yes it is \n",
    "everything I dreamed it would be.  You feel so special when you walk on the red carpet and hear them  clapping. (Of \n",

    "spent a month traveling in Madrid, Cordoba, Sevilla, Prague, Alexandria, Marsa Matrouh and Cairo.  I swam in the most \n",
    "spectacularly warm Mediterranean waters. Yes, me the hydrophobic swam in the deep water for hours on end. The good \n",
    "news is that salty water makes you more buoyant and some people are naturally more buoyant than others (I  m not telling \n",
    "you why) so I was floating happy.  Now, when I  m in the sun, I always generously slather sunscreen all over my body.  \n",
    "However, I didn't have it on my lips when I enjoyed 6 or 7 hours in the sparkling, turquoise water.  Within minutes of \n",
    "dragging myself out of the refreshing sea, my lips began to swell and blister.  As I was looking for some sympathy from \n",
    "my husband, he turned and said I should be happy about my very large and sore lips.  He said people pay big money to get \n",
    "collagen in their lips and now my lips were huge for free.  (Do you think he is focusing on saving money because all his \n",
    "  promotions   bring no money?) We decided to travel this winter as well. We used Nasr  s GPS system to get us into the \n",
    "Wisconsin rural wilderness.  The signs inside the hotel rooms warned us against walking the trails because the pheasant \n",
    "hunters might mistake Nasr  s plume of hair for a pheasant.  I have a thing for water this year.  In summer I swim in it and \n",
    "in the winter, I throw it.  My siblings and I managed to change a beautiful pristine snow-covered garden (first blizzard of \n",
    "the year) into a battlefield of freezing snowballs. We had loads of fun, but I forgot my gloves and now my hands are \n",
    "aching with arthritis and pain.  If Nasr tells me the rich and famous put their hands in ice cold snow to shrink the wrinkles, \n",
    "I may send him on an errand through the pheasant filled hiking trails.  Later that same evening, my siblings and I danced \n",
    "and caroused on the dance floor at my niece  s wedding. We all used to wonder why our nieces and nephews were afraid to \n",
