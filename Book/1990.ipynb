    "SEASON'S GREETINGS!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another year has passed and I'm not ready to write a Christmas letter. Give me another couple of months and maybe I'll be ready for Christmas.\n",
    "But then again I just may procrastinate and end up writing, buying and wrapping in the last two weeks just like I am now. Maybe when technology\n",
    "gets better I'll be sending you a video of the events of the year. Wouldn't that be great. I'd have a camera going all year long in each room of\n",
    "the house. Then I'd just edit out the \"good stuff and pass that along. Egads! Can you imagine how long it would take to edit a whole year of\n",
    "five people's lives? I guess I'll stick to my ancient ways of using the word processor and laser printer.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASR has been home most of the year and now I don't have much to complain about, nor do I get to describe those beautiful picturesque places\n",
    "that he has visited. Starting in January he's taking a sabbatical so maybe next Christmas I'll describes scenes of beautiful downtown Santa\n",
    "Barbara! Well, he can't travel the world every seven years. If he did, life would get pretty boring and what would we have to look forward to?\n",
    "As of this summer, you can call my husband Farmer Nasr. He planted over 60 tomato plants and almost as many lettuce plants. We are still eating\n",
    "tomatoes and will be for quite a while. There were too many lettuce plants even for this family of rabbits to eat and many of them went to seed.\n",
    "But never fear, even after tilling everything under, the lettuce plants are coming back in full force and there are close to a hundred little\n",
    "plants sprouting. If they survive the \"winter\" we may not have to buy lettuce for quite a while. Yes, Nasr has been working this year. He's been\n",
    "busy consulting, researching and teaching. He's also been forced to help get the kids ready for school in the morning. At first it was pure\n",
    "torture for him, but now he's got it down to an art. Actually, I think the kids like it best when Dad makes breakfast because he makes fun\n",
    "things like hash browns, eggs, waffles, and special toast sandwiches. (Mom doesn't eat that wonderful stuff so there's no way that she'll make\n",
    "it. But the rest of the family all think its great.)\n",
    "\n",
    "VIRGINIA has spent the past year doing her stint of student teaching. Actually it is slave labor, but school boards and universities don't like\n",
    "to call it that. Imagine putting in 8 to 10 hours a day for four months trying to control and teach 30 \"wonderful\" children and getting paid\n",
    "zip! I can't complain because now its over and I'm officially a TEACHER. I never knew what a teacher really did until I worked as a substitute\n",
    "and did my internship. It may be different in the midwest, but teachers just can't impart academic information, they have to be the be all to\n",
    "end all to the children in the classroom. This year I'm teaching a classroom of Cambodian children. These children have seen more cruelties and\n",
    "inhumanities to man than all of us combined have seen. They are not easy to teach, but when I do reach and teach them, it's a special moment.\n",
    "When it comes to writing, I think my next book will be the wonderfully sad, funny and poignant moments in a classroom of young modern\n",
    "immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMI (AKA Amira) is an 11 year old young lady of surprising talents. I never imagined that Ami would be an athlete, but this year she has shown\n",
    "what she can do. In the spring she competed in track and won several ribbons and medals. This fall she's out for soccer and their team is going\n",
    "to be playing in the play-offs. Ami and her best friend, Rachel are inseparable. They look like Mutt and Jeff and if you find one of them,\n",
    "you'll find them both. My little girl is now a sixth grader and she's desperately trying to teach Mom what is cool. I've learned it is not cool\n",
    "to blow you nose because well, you know, someone might hear it. But the thing that ignorant, uncool Mom can't figure out is, why is it cool to\n",
    "breathe through your mouth, sound like your dying and have \"yuck\" streaming out of your nose? If anyone can tell Mom why the first is uncool and\n",
    "the second is cool, please write and explain. Everyone these days seems to have a wide variety of the different sizes and shapes of water\n",
    "bottles. Ami is no exception. One minute Ami and Rachel have their matching water bottles, which are colorful baby bottles and are happily\n",
    "drinking from them. The next minute she gets a call from one of the boys in her class. It's true, they grow up in a flash.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM is 8 and is all rough and tumble boy. He's doing wonderfully in school and his ability to memorize is going to take him places. He told his\n",
    "Dad he's going to go to school a few extra years so he can learn even more. (Dad cringed, because at one point he contemplated paying for the\n",
    "childrens' education.) Adam is out for soccer also this year and he and his Dad have great games. I haven't decided who cheats more, but Adam\n",
    "makes the most noise so I'm inclined to think it's Dad. Adam and Mom like to go hiking together, particularly in the winter. We've discovered\n",
    "the park that has yellow prairie grass that looks as smooth as lions fur. Adam pointed out the grey brush that looks like the prickly hair of an\n",
    "elephant. The rocks have faces, puppies and dragons carved by nature. With Adam's imagination he may be a writer like Mom because when we come\n",
    "home from hiking Adam heads for the computer and starts writing about where we've been and what we've seen for extra credit in school. (Maybe\n",
    "Adam will be writing his Christmas letter and describing all the scenic places he's been.)\n",
    "\n",
    "JASMINE is four and going on about 37. I'll never worry about Jazz succeeding in this world. At UCLA when she was getting yogurt with her Dad\n",
    "she wanted the chocolate Jimmy's. Dad said no. She screamed, ranted, raved and insisted. So to shut her up, the woman behind the counter gave\n",
    "them to Jazz. She's learning early that squeaky wheels get oiled. But I'm afraid that one day, someone is going to grease her good! As a treat\n",
    "for Nasr we were given several pigeons to barbecue. I was cleaning them when suddenly I realized that hanging onto the neck was a dangling head.\n",
    "Ughhh. I screamed and informed Nasr if he was to eat pigeon he had to behead the birds. Jasmine was watching this whole scene and wouldn't allow\n",
    "Nasr to throw the heads away. She tried licking the heads, but Mom held back a scream and told her we don't lick unattached heads. She had\n",
    "several long conversations with these heads and then she decided that Butterscotch, our dog, should have the heads. But the dog is smarter than\n",
    "I thought. She wouldn't have anything to do with those heads. This worried Jasmine so she asked if we should call the police because the\n",
    "Butterscotch wouldn't eat the head. I calmly told her it really wasn't a matter for the police. She looked at me with those big blue eyes and\n",
    "said. \"Oh, then we'll have to call in the army!\" I don't know how Jazz thought the army would help, but as the holiday seasons approach I hope\n",
    "that the U.S doesn't have to call out its army and that this holiday season will be filled with peace. I also pray that this letter finds each\n",
    "and every one of you in good health and brimming with happiness."

    "SEASON'S GREETINGS!\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you believe that I wrote \"Seasoned\" greetings? That Freudian slip is very appropriate. The Ghoniem life is seasoned with fanciful and exotic\n",
    "spices and interspersed with coffee dregs. But, it's been a good year for us two \"seasoned\" veterans of child rearing. Each year the seasoning\n",
    "gives us more wisdom and we are able to philosophize about life. We've learned why children are so fascinated with the Merry-Go-Round. It\n",
    "teaches them when they are our age, uhm-over 21, that life really is a merry-go-round. However, I better teach my children how to get off it.\n",
    "Right now I'm riding the confounded thing and it doesn't stop, and I can't get off. Anyone who has any good suggestions on how to get off,\n",
    "painlessly, please write.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASR, over 21 a couple of times plus, has had a great year. He took a six month sabbatical and spent it in Santa Barbara. This would have been\n",
    "fine with me, but I found out that the engineering building is only a quick hop to the beach. He spent his lunch hours studying on the sand.\n",
    "However, the only structural analysis he was making was on the young co-eds in their bikinis. Don't you feel sorry for a guy who has to do such\n",
    "gruelling tasks? Also, Nasr's parents spent a wonderful and helpful 6 months with us. Nasr got the chance, for the first time, to do some\n",
    "carpentry work with his father on projects for the house. When it was all over, they were like identical twins beaming with pride. Nasr is\n",
    "busier than ever this year teaching and consulting. His merry-go-round is keeping him so busy that we sometimes wave as we keep circling.\n",
    "\n",
    "VIRGINIA, at least 21, is busy working full time at Gault Street as the afternoon kindergarten teacher. I'm finished with my clear credential!\n",
    "YEAH! Last week was the greatest thrill of my \"seasoned\" life. A waiter, (half my age) wanted to make sure I was 21. I was so pleased that he\n",
    "got a kiss. I think he'll be more careful who he cards from now on. My writing has only been academic papers, but I'm hoping next semester I'll\n",
    "have a chance to be creative again. I'll fit it around the several Spanish courses I'll be taking so I can communicate with the children in my\n",
    "classroom. I've also set a goal for second semester. My goal is to make dinner two nights a week. If you ask Nasr, (be careful, he may grumble\n",
    "and growl) he'll tell you that I only cooked two meals all semester. Whoever invented already prepared frozen foods will be in my will-well\n",
    "she's at least in my prayers because she gets enough of my paycheck as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMIRA will be 12 on January 6. She still prefers to be called Ami, but Mom at least has to use her official name once a year. She is in the 7th\n",
    "grade and taking honors classes. It's not that I'm proud of my daughter, but she got straight A's in her honors classes. (Of course, we all know\n",
    "where she got her intelligence from. Be careful how you answer that!) We say thank God she has the capabilities and pray she'll do something\n",
    "profitable with them. (When she was 5 she promised to buy Nasr and I a Mercedes when she got out of college. Hopefully, she'll use her brains to\n",
    "make lots of money. I'm waiting for my Mercedes. Remember, I'm a teacher; I can't buy it on my salary.) Ami was in soccer again this year and\n",
    "her team did quite well. Ami is also good in athletics and won the sportsmanship trophy. Ami is successful because she has a method for\n",
    "everything. Ami's bed is always made and her method for keeping her bed made is that she never sleeps under the covers. She grabs an extra\n",
    "blanket, suffers by being cold, but mind you, her bed is ALWAYS made.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM is 9 and in the fourth grade. He is doing great in school. He is on the student council, involved in lots of activities and is even in 5th\n",
    "grade math. Adam is one of the best players on his soccer team and now they have made it to the play offs. Adam also won the sportsmanship\n",
    "trophy. (Mom's merry-go-round will slow down a little now that she's not chauffeuring to soccer 4 nights a week. YEAH! Oops, that slipped out.)\n",
    "Adam is a very environmentally concerned child. He knows more about the environment and what horrible things we adults are doing to it. He has\n",
    "big plans to clean up the earth and make it a better place to live. (I hope he's more successful at that than he is with cleaning up his room.\n",
    "That is an environmental hazard.) Once Adam gets engrossed in a project or in many cases, gets mesmerized by the television, he has a hard time\n",
    "focusing on what he should be doing. I'll know because many a day I'll find the legos in the refrigerator and the food on the counter, or find\n",
    "the t.v. remote control in the cupboard next to his chips. But even though he sometimes has a hard time focussing on the issue at hand, other\n",
    "times he hits it right on the head, or in this case, right on his Dad's head. He looked his Dad straight in the eye and said, \"Daddy, is the\n",
    "shiny spot on your head the light from the light bulbs inside your brain when you get an idea.\" (Some people might call it a bald spot.)\n",
    "\n",
    "JASMINE is 5 and going on 35! She's in kindergarten and according to Jazz, life in kindergarten is great! She's now a game leader and she's\n",
    "losing a tooth. Those are the two most important aspects of kindergarten. Last Easter we got chicks and bunnies for the children. Well, bunnies\n",
    "turn into RABBITS, and chicks turn into CHICKENS. I never could acquire any affection for chickens, but Jazz adopted these two birds and loves\n",
    "them dearly. She hugs grown chickens like I would hug a puppy. She clucks to them and yes, they do answer her back. They seem content to be\n",
    "squashed onto the chaise lounge so Jasmine can have their full attention. Jazz is into the question stage of her life. One question I got was,\n",
    "\"Who is Mississippi?\" \"It's a big river,\" I answered. She frowned, looked very puzzled and then said, \"Oh. I thought there was a teacher named\n",
    "Miss Issippi.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One Saturday, not too long ago, the house desperately needed to be cleaned. (Nasr was coming home from one of his trips and I didn't want him to\n",
    "see how we really live when he's away.) The only way the cleaning was going to get done was if the children helped to clean it. I put on my 50's\n",
    "and 60's music very loud. (I think the loud part pleased the children the most.) And miracles of miracles, all three children started cleaning\n",
    "and they cleaned WITHOUT fighting. Adam was enjoying the music so much that he grabbed a broom and started dancing with it. Ami took the vacuum\n",
    "cleaner hose and used it as a microphone. She put on a great show. Jazz danced and was too busy having fun to mess up what was already cleaned\n",
    "up. Maybe the conservatives from the 50's were right when they said there was some sort of subliminal messages in the music. If it made my\n",
    "children clean without fighting, hey I'm all for it. This letter is long, but a lot happens in a year. I wish I could sit with everyone of you\n",
    "and hear your stories. Friends and family are precious gifts and I wish I could spend more time with each one of you. But remember, if you can\n",
    "read this, you can also write us and tell us your news or call on the phone. Jasmine has a very clear understanding of how useful a phone is.\n",
    "She knows it allows you to communicate with important people. One of her questions was, \"What's God's telephone number?\" I don't have God's\n",
    "number, but I do try to stay in touch. I hope all of you are blessed with good health and happiness and by the way, if anyone does know God's\n",

    "know we are still here and still in one piece. (We only have a few screws loose.) It's surprising that we are still intact considering the\n",

    "spent endless hours getting the right programs and the systems adjusted perfectly. He also has played musical computer. He had a difficult time\n",
    "figuring out where he wanted to put it. First it was in my kitchen taking up MY desk space and MY kitchen drawers. Then it was moved to a bigger\n",

    "beautiful, self-motivated, young lady. (So, I'm a little prejudice, it's a mother's prerogative.) Ami can save money very easily. She has a\n",
    "spendable account in the bank (not a college fund) and she is counting the days until she can have her own ATM card. This is true power, a sign\n",

    "different philosophies on the need for work, the discussion often gets heated and a quite LOUD!. Why is it that when I tell him what he should\n",
    "be doing, he doesn't seem to accept it as well as I accept his little suggestions on saving the environment? Do you think it would help if I\n",

    "inseparable. The other day, Jasmine was provoking Adam and I must say Adam used a great deal of self-control, because that is one thing Adam is\n",
    "NOT known for. He turned to Jasmine with his dark brown eyes blazing and said, \"When I'm awake and tired, I'm potentially dangerous.\" Jasmine\n",
    "was not astute enough to recognize the threat, but when a ten year old lets you know that he is potentially dangerous, look out! Is this a\n",

    "in love with the Dalmatians. Almost every article of clothing she owns has a dalmatian on it. She must have 50 dalmatian items or more. I do not\n",
    "think that it would be too much to ask that Disney sent us a personal Christmas card this year as Jazz has helped support them and has added to\n",
    "their profits heavily. Now, I wouldn't want anyone to call me a meddling mother, but Jazz is going to be a top notch business PERSON when she\n",
    "grows up. Jazz is the exact opposite of Adam when it comes to money. She has no desire to spend any of her money. However, the one similarity\n",
    "she does have with Adam is his philosophy about working for money. She is somewhat easier to convince she must clean up her room to earn her\n",
    "money. She does not earn as much as the other two, but she tries to make up for it. If we tell her she will get 2 dollars a week for cleaning her\n",

    "During this Christmas season, when I watch Jazz counting her money I am reminded of Scrooge. Several times a day this child counts her money.\n",
    "And she doesn't like  20 dollar bills. It doesn't look like enough money. She wants everything in ones. She uses several wallets and keeps asking for\n",
    "more because the ones she has are too small. The other day she came up to me and asked me quite innocently, \"Mom, can a five or six year old kid\n",
    "start to be a millionaire?\" It took a few moments to pick my jaw off the floor, but I smiled and said, \"Of course!\" If my child wants to be a\n",

    "Greetings and Felicitations of the Season! \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, I know felicitations is an archaic word but as time passes by I find that I'm getting more archaic also. (But under oath I will say that I\n",
    "wrote that under utter duress.) This holiday season I tried to get my act together and get this letter out early. (My act is still in pieces so\n",
    "you're getting this closer to New Years than Christmas.) This year we did a lot of things together as a family. And yes, we still are together.\n",
    "There are times when family togetherness can break up the family, but we somehow managed to muddle through. Perhaps the unusual, scenic,\n",
    "Mediterranean atmosphere helped us appreciate each other. But I think the real reason we all got along so well was because there were enough\n",
    "adults around. We were able to pawn off the kids for a little while so they didn't drive us absolutely mad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr is at the age of forty-something now and we all love to remind him of his antiquity. He is still working at UCLA and he loves it (except\n",
    "when he has to teach four hours a day!) Now those of us who are teachers of the younger persuasion (meaning we teach younger kids) teach six\n",
    "hours a day, everyday, not every other day. Do you feel sorry for him? Me neither! But we do have to make allowances for those of advanced age.\n",
    "Nasr also is the epitome of the absent-minded professor. The day after Thanksgiving I got my hair cut. It was very long, almost to the middle of\n",
    "my back. I cut it to chin length. EVERYONE noticed it the minute they saw me. Nasr, sat down, told me about his computer problems, looked\n",
    "straight at me for over an hour and didn't mention a thing. Finally Adam took pity on him (Adam saw the smoke coming from my ears) and told him\n",
    "that I cut my hair. Nasr called down from upstairs, \"Let me see this haircut. What does it look like?\" Can we blame this on his antiquity too?\n",
    "We spent the summer in Egypt and Nasr had a wonderful time with his family and friends. He spent hours in the water and swam like he did as a\n",
    "child. I haven't seen him this relaxed in years. We enjoyed it so much that we want to go back every two years if monies allow!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia's age is really-something she doesn't wish to discuss. 1993 was a year of taking it easy. I wasn't taking classes at the university,\n",
    "but I still managed to work full time and earn 12 credits taking Spanish classes and getting my Language Development Specialist Credential.\n",
    "Sounds impressive? It's not. All it means is that I know how to teach English as a Second Language, and I get a little more money. Los Angeles\n",
    "is back to a traditional school calendar. Last year was great, I had 8 weeks off in January and February and then about 3 months off in the\n",
    "summer. This year I only get two weeks in December and I feel deprived. Egypt was great for me. It was the true vacation. I didn't clean, cook,\n",
    "or care for the kids. I played, danced, swam and talked. Did I mention I didn't have to cook or clean or care for the kids? It was a real\n",
    "culture shock for me when I came back to LA and I had to go back to being a mom and a responsible person. I guess I must have succeeded in being\n",
    "responsible because this is how the three kids see me. Ami says I'm exciting and eccentric, Adam says I'm cool and Jasmine says I'm romantic.\n",
    "It's funny, they said all those nice things and they didn't want anything. Maybe they are waiting to extract payment later. This could be a plot\n",
    "to soften me up. Well, if at a weak moment, you see me open up my wallet and give them money or buy them something when they really don't\n",
    "deserve it, just remember they pre-paid in compliments and it makes Mom feel good.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ami, days away from 14, is the true scholar of the family. She graduated from junior high this 1 spring as valedictorian. In layman's terms,\n",
    "that means she graduated with all A's and was number one in her class. I wish I could take the credit for all these brains, but I think her\n",
    "absent minded professor dad gets a lot of credit for that. This year Ami is taking geometry. Now, when I was in high school, about a hundred\n",
    "years ago, I took geometry. So one evening when Ami couldn't wake up her dad from a sound sleep (at 8:00 p.m.) to help her with her math, she\n",
    "came to Mom for help. I thought I could help, but once she started stating all the postulates and theorems, I knew I was in BIG trouble.\n",
    "(Remember, I'm the literary person in the family.) I took one look at those angles and I said \"Those are angles that could maybe...\n",
    "possibly....\" Then my very intelligent daughter could read my mind and she said, \"Oh, now I get it. This is the way it is done. \" She went on to\n",
    "explain in full detail exactly what needed to be done. I panicked as I waited for the second question. Thankfully, she could again could read my\n",
    "mind after a few uhms and ahs. Next time though I\"m waking Nasr up. Why should I panic when math comes so naturally to him? Ami is really into\n",
    "soccer this year. She has been playing every other day all season. She played her last game in the pouring rain and miraculously didn't catch\n",
    "pneumonia. She has been elected to play for the all-stars. She is very excited about this, but Mom was hoping she would get a rest from soccer\n",
    "practice. Ami is also keeping up with her piano, but she is teaching herself. Ami liked Egypt, but she caught a miserable cough and it took four\n",
    "months to get rid of it. She learned how to jet-ski in the Mediterranean and she can swim a great distance into the sea and back. One thing she\n",
    "didn't appreciate was the fact that in Egypt the carcass of the cow is hung outside the door of the butcher shop or restaurant and pieces of\n",
    "meat are removed as needed. I almost got her to eat lamb, in a restaurant, in the desert, outside of El-Alamain, until she saw the meat being\n",
    "carried in a pink, plastic bag on top of a car through the Sahara. After that, she wouldn't even walk past the meat. She went out the back door\n",
    "just to avoid the meat hanging in the doorway. But she had fun in Egypt!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is eleven and dating. Yes, I said dating. However, this was done without Mom's approval or KNOWLEDGE. The story he told Mom was that he was\n",
    "going out with his friend. I found out several hours later, that he was at the movies double dating with his friend. If this was a Saturday\n",
    "matinee, I might have been slightly miffed, but this was a Friday night and he walked down a major street in LOS ANGELES with only his friends.\n",
    "He survived to talk about it, but I warned him if he even thought about dating before he was 21 I'd do something drastic. (I know he's already\n",
    "thought about it, so if you have any good suggestions of something drastic that I can do, please let me know. ) Adam is in the 6th grade and is\n",
    "in junior high. It is hard for me to imagine that Adam is in junior high, but he is very tall and all too soon, he will be towering over me.\n",
    "Adam is becoming much more helpful around the house when the mood strikes. It doesn't strike very often, but when it does he manages to fix\n",
    "things that Nasr has been avoiding. He fixed the outdoor lamp by his basketball hoop that Nasr ignored for a year. Do you think he had an\n",
    "ulterior motive? Adam is still at the dreaming stage. Each week he is going to be something different when he grows up. He wanted to be a film\n",
    "producer and movie-maker. The fact that they are filming a movie at the end of our street may play some role in the interest he has in this. He\n",
    "talked for a long time with the producer of this movie and he wanted to make great movies, too. As of today, he wants to be an astronaut and an\n",
    "engineer like his dad. He wants to take over his dad's company once Dad has made it big. Adam's got the business mentality. He's a little\n",
    "concerned about being an astronaut because they have to learn to be in isolation for long periods of time when they are travelling through\n",
    "space.\n",
    "\n",
    "He's not so sure he can handle that because when he was in isolation for dating, he wasn't happy at all. Adam is also becoming very musical.\n",
    "He's trying to take up the guitar and piano by teaching himself. He is a little more successful so far with the piano. He keeps hinting that he\n",
    "wants to take guitar and piano lessons after Christmas, but I'm not so sure he'll stay with them. I like the idea that he is taking the\n",
    "initiative and doing it on his own. I even offered to help, but it seems that the times when he wants help and the time that I'm available to\n",
    "help him don't coincide. Adam also had a great time in Egypt. Adam is under the belief that whatever Nasr can do, he can do better, especially\n",
    "when it comes to swimming in the Mediterranean. Nasr would swim out into the very deep water and Adam was his shadow. It scared me half to\n",
    "death, but Adam didn't stop to think that he was in water 50 feet deep or more. Maybe he's used to being in deep HOT water with Mom.\n",

    "Jasmine is seven going on 37. She is very grown up for her age and tries to use the most sophisticated language. However, it is her own\n",
    "language. Like her mom, she finds great refuge in the \"frig-derator\". It is amazing how all the cookies and chips in the house seem to\n",
    "\"sip-appear.\" She loves to have meals of \"piss-getti and hambugers\". I have a hot financial tip for all of you who follow the stock market. Make\n",
    "sure you invest in any and every toy company that makes toy horses. If the amount of money we've spent on these creatures is any indication,\n",
    "these companies are doing fantastic and making gobs of money. You guessed it, Jazz likes horses. You also might be wise to invest in paper and\n",
    "crayon companies because if Jazz is not playing with the horses, she is drawing them. We received, as a gift, a picture of horses done in silk\n",
    "that was painted by the daughter of the last emperor of China. Now, Jasmine, having such a recently famous name as Princess Jasmine, has decided\n",
    "that her horse drawings are going to be as famous as the emperor's daughter's drawing. Let's hope! Jasmine also rode her own Arabian horse\n",
    "around the Pyramids in the Sahara desert. But I don't think that it compared to the two painted and flocked ponies that came to the house for\n",
    "her birthday. She rode them with the greatest of pride and tried unsuccessfully to convince Mom to buy her one. I know our house is zoned for\n",
    "horses, but I know who would have to take care of them, and Grandpa just won't give up his lifestyle in the cold, Wisconsin winters to take care\n",
    "of these creatures. Or will you, Daddy?\n",
    "\n",
    "This year has been an interesting and fulfilling year. Last week on my way to yet another test, (yes, I've been tested a lot this year in more\n",
    "ways than one) I watched the haze of a cloudy sunrise over the mountains of the Angeles National Forest. I was listening to Christmas carols in\n",

    "and earthshaking love. I hope all of you will have your own special Christmas and your own wonderful memories that make each Christmas unique\n",
    "and unforgettable. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Here's to 1994! May it bring everything you desire and deserve?\n",

    "Canyon, to Sedona, Arizona, to Las Vegas, to Bakersfield, Ca.and onto Yosemite National Park. If Nasr hadn't gotten ill, we would have continued\n",
    "on for another three days and visited 4 more cities along the California coast. (Lesson learned: Do not let Nasr plan any future trips because\n",
    "he wants to do it all in 30 seconds or less.) Nasr had so much fun traveling this summer (or maybe he had too much \"togetherness\" with his wife\n",

    "Nasr has been the happy wanderer this past year.  He has travelled to many cities in the U.S., Mexico, Denmark, Chile, Japan, Portugal, Spain,\n",
    "Egypt, and of course China. I have to reintroduce myself to him because he's spent more time in other countries than he has at home.  He has\n",
    "some fine memories of the trips and he has brought back many pearls of wisdom.  The pearls that were most precious to me, were the black and\n",
    "corral pearl necklaces from China.  ( No, I am not above using guilt to get my gifts.)  His memories (and you know the over 50 crowd can't\n",
    "remember much) include walking in the Imperial Palace and on the Great Wall of China, swimming in the lagoons of the Mexican Caribbean, learning\n",
    "about the fine wines of Portugal, living in a monastery in the mountains of northern Spain, reminiscing with old friends and family along the\n",
    "shores of the Mediterranean, reliving the horrors of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, and most importantly, watching the water go down the toilet\n",
    "clockwise instead of counter-clockwise in Chile. (He's an engineer so he notices these things.) Yes, these were business trips.  Do you\n",
    "sometimes get the impression that you are in the wrong business? Things are going well for Nasr, but he is obsessed with \"dislocations.\"  Very\n",

    "Virginia is now an Assistant Principal. I actually travelled with Nasr this year. The entire family went to Cancun, Mexico, which was pure\n",
    "relaxation-just what the doctor ordered.  (At least that's what I told my boss.)  Nasr and I had a second honeymoon in Copenhagen, Denmark.  If\n",
    "your children visit, make sure they are married and don't watch the television in the hotels.  I learned some new things from the TV and we've\n",
    "been married for almost 24 years.  Denmark was the first real vacation for me.  My friend took time off to show me around during the day and I\n",
    "got to do what I wanted.  I didn't have to mediate between the whims and desires of the children.  (There are some advantages to getting older,\n",
    "or at least having older children because they can take care of themselves for a short time.)  I saw my mother's Danish heritage, (tall blonde\n",

    "cannot wear shoes to an exam. Remember, Ami is an engineer and must feel free to think. She wears sandals to the exams so she can easily remove\n",
    "them and take the exam barefoot.  One of her professors used his digital camera and sent pictures over the internet of Ami sitting in the front\n",
    "of the classroom, barefoot and in deep concentration.  For all of us who do not have a 4.0 grade point average, this might be a strategy to help\n",
    "us.  Or, it may simply be another Ghoniem idiosyncrasy, but do not poo-poo something that works.  She is working very hard and all the hard work\n",
    "is paying off.  Ami did her summer internship at Hughes Space and Communications.  She loved it and this gave her the opportunity to find out\n",
    "what happens in industry.  Of course, since she had to commute the long distance to El Segundo during the summer, Ami needed a car.  Her new,\n",
    "green, 1999 Honda Civic EX helped her travel to work and to San Francisco at the end of the summer.  San Francisco was an eye opener for her.\n",
    "She discovered that driving the one way streets with steep hills and crazy drivers was a driving experience she does not want to repeat.  She\n",
    "did enjoy crepes, Golden Gate park where people were dancing on roller blades, and the area called Haight Ashbury.  According to Ami, there are\n",
    "a lot of fun shops and interesting people.  As I recall, Haight Ashbury  was filled with \"fun\" shops and \"interesting\" people in the 1960's.  It\n",

    "Adam is 17 and is suffering from the dreaded disease \"Senioritis.\"  Ami had it and it only took three years before Adam was infected.  For those\n",
    "of you who are lucky enough to have younger children, I will describe \"Senioritis.\"  It begins with the attitude that \"I know it all and you\n",
    "can't tell me anything.\"  Students infected with the disease do not see any purpose in studying because this is their last year and the only\n",
    "grades that count are your grades from 10th and 11th grade.  They cannot understand why they need a curfew and a curfew of 12:30 a.m. is\n",
    "\"ridiculous\" because EVERYONE else can go home when they want to.  They want to make their own decisions and it doesn't matter that they are\n",
    "making the wrong decisions. They don't need to study for the college entrance exams because it is a \"waste of time.\"   There are three chances\n",
    "to take the college entrance exams and there is no reason to take it more than once.  \"No matter how hard I study, I won't do any better!\"  is\n",
    "the usual response.  They believe if you don't have fun in your senior year, you will never have fun.  They believe a job is more important than\n",
    "studying for the college entrance exams.  \"Who can live on an allowance of \\$100.00 a month?\" is also a common complaint.   I'm hoping that,\n",
    "like Ami, this disease will be cured by the time he goes to college in the fall.   Adam had been driving my 1986 station wagon and all cars have\n",
    "a lifetime and this one just couldn't live through Adam's senior year.  We cried.   Adam rejoiced!  Adam now drives a new, red, 1999 Honda Civic\n",
    "DX.  The Ghoniems are single handedly supporting the Honda corporation.   Adam is captain of the volleyball team, but he had to suffer through\n",
    "Homecoming on crutches.  Some people have glass jaws, Adam has glass ankles.  He only has two ankles and I think he has broken five of them. If\n",
    "anyone has an immediate cure or prevention of senioritis, please tell me because we will be rich when we market it.\n",
