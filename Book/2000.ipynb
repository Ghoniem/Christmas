    "Adam is 18 and is a freshman at the University of California at Santa Barbara .  He is staying in a dorm that overlooks the Pacific Ocean.  If you have been reading these letters over the years, you will recall that Nasr spent a sabbatical in Santa Barbara.  The view, according to Adam, hasn't changed.  The beaches are still filled with bikini-clad bodies and muscled surfers in wet suits.  Yes, Adam is really studying.  He is studying to be an Electrical Engineer.  (I think there is an echo from a previous child, and a little pressure from Dad.)  If you recall, in my last letter I spoke of the Adam's dreaded disease--senior-itis.  If I gave you the impression that the disease was bad in December, let me tell you, by June is was ALMOST incurable.  I received a phone call two days before graduation that Adam may not graduate because he didn't like to attend art class! (Of course, Nasr was in Washington D.C at the time.)  I don't know who suffered more from the disease, Mom or Adam.  It turned out that he made the number of classes that he is allowed to miss by only one!  He did graduate and now he is doing very well in Santa Barbara.  All the words of encouragement that we gave him finally sunk in.  Or maybe it was someone who has more influence on him told him he could get straight A's.  He's on his way to getting them.  He got a 100% and a 90% on two chemistry midterms.  He finds chemistry easy.  Now he realizes that school is really not that hard if you open a book, read it and listen to the professors lecture.  (Isn't that an amazing concept?) Adam is doing so well in chemistry that he decided to work on his own chemistry project.  He and a friend were hungry for brownies.  It was a seven hour process that included a one hour hike to the store, 10 extra eggs, a mixing bowl that was actually a zip lock bag that could handle excessive squishing, and microwave baking because no real oven could be found.   Adam's chemistry experiment yielded brownies that were burned in the center, because the microwave bakes inside out.  But, they were the best brownies he ever tasted.\n",
