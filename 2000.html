<p>Greetings of the Season Once Again!</p>
<p>This has been a year of changes, growth and a myriad of old and new experiences for the Ghoniems.  Once again I am listening to relaxing
instrumental holiday carols on my headset.  I am hoping this will help me get into the Holiday mood, but I mainly use it to drown out the techno
music that is blasting and blaring throughout the house</p>
<p>Nasr is enjoying his work this year.  He spends at least one day a week, sometimes two, working at home.  Between the computer and telephone
conferencing, he really only has to be at the university one afternoon a week to teach his class. He has gotten the house spruced up for the
holidays and now he is just sitting back and admiring the fruits of his labor and sweating over the bills.  You would think at this point in his
life he would have figured out that the big fancy things we buy will eventually come back to bite us with a big bill.  However, he still
grumbles over it. (Is that a man thing?)  Nasr traveled again this year.  He spent over a month in Hong Kong, and then spent weeks in Japan,
Paris, Barcelona, Boston, San Francisco, and Alexandria, Egypt, just to name a few.  He did take Ami, Jazz, and myself on a couple of trips this
year.  We can now prove that these are not as stressful as he claims.  Of course, some may feel that seeing ancient and not so ancient sights
and dining out every night on exotic foods with great friends and family may be stressful, but I’m not one of them.  Are you?</p>
<p>Virginia has been promoted to Principal.  I am now the Principal at Pomelo Elementary in West Hills. This school is not the typical Los Angeles
school, but it still comes with its own peculiar challenges.  It is one of the highest-ranking schools in the district and of course, there is
no pressure on Virginia to continue this legacy.  (I’m lying!)  All the time that Nasr gets to spend at home, I’m making up for it at work.  I
put in long hours both at work and at home.  (This does not add any stress at home, either.)  This year I had the opportunity to travel to Hong
Kong and Japan with Nasr.  I still cannot believe that I’ve been to the South Pacific during the monsoon season.  Yes, it is warm and wet, but
very green.  We stayed on the Kowloon Peninsula on the 17th floor of the Harbor Plaza hotel overlooking Victoria Bay with a view of the lights
of the high rise buildings on Hong Kong Island.  Oh so romantic!  (Did I tell you Jazz traveled with us?) (Note to self–Take a companion for
Jazz so she can have her own room.)  Hong Kong is made up of over 200 islands and each one a treasure and a sight to see.  We have great friends
in Hong Kong who made our stay fun-filled and exciting.   We then traveled to Japan and traveled the length of it from Hiroshima, to Kyoto to
Tokyo.  It is clean and very organized.  With my new job, I actually have my summers off and Nasr already has tickets to travel.  The past
couple of years we have not had the chance to travel together so expect some interesting travel exploits next year.</p>
<p>Ami is a senior at UCLA.  She is taking 20, 19 and 18 units respectively over the quarters this year.  Yes, she is very busy.  She plans to
attend graduate school next year in Electrical Engineering.   She applied to Stanford, Berkley and San Diego.  It looks like this will be the
last year we have Ami at home with us.  (I may need psychological help to handle her moving out.  The tone of next year’s letter will tell you
how it has affected my sanity.)  Ami has discovered ancient –no make that modern Egyptian treasures.   This summer she traveled to Europe and
Egypt with her dad and discovered golden twinkling treasures and the jeweled sparkling Mediterranean Sea.  (Translation:  She found new friends,
nightclubs in which to dance and a white sandy beach on which to play and sunbathe, while Dad was relaxing with his friends and family.)  There
is an old Egyptian belief that once you drink the water of the Nile, you must return.  I don’t know how much Nile water Ami drank, but she loved
Egypt so much that she is going back in December.  However, I don’t think that it is the Nile that is beckoning her.  I think it has more to do
with the fact that she will be celebrating New Years and her 21st birthday in the European party resort–Sharm El Sheik on the Red Sea.  Ami
will be snorkeling in the most beautiful water during the day and dancing the night away in the most expensive nightclubs in Egypt.  Mom and Dad
have already begun to hyperventilate.  We keep telling ourselves that she is or almost is 21 and she deserves this trip because of her good
grades and being an all around good kid, but she is going by herself.  This saga to be continued in the next letter.</p>
<p>Adam is 18 and is a freshman at the University of California at Santa Barbara .  He is staying in a dorm that overlooks the Pacific Ocean.  If you have been reading these letters over the years, you will recall that Nasr spent a sabbatical in Santa Barbara.  The view, according to Adam, hasn’t changed.  The beaches are still filled with bikini-clad bodies and muscled surfers in wet suits.  Yes, Adam is really studying.  He is studying to be an Electrical Engineer.  (I think there is an echo from a previous child, and a little pressure from Dad.)  If you recall, in my last letter I spoke of the Adam’s dreaded disease–senior-itis.  If I gave you the impression that the disease was bad in December, let me tell you, by June is was ALMOST incurable.  I received a phone call two days before graduation that Adam may not graduate because he didn’t like to attend art class! (Of course, Nasr was in Washington D.C at the time.)  I don’t know who suffered more from the disease, Mom or Adam.  It turned out that he made the number of classes that he is allowed to miss by only one!  He did graduate and now he is doing very well in Santa Barbara.  All the words of encouragement that we gave him finally sunk in.  Or maybe it was someone who has more influence on him told him he could get straight A’s.  He’s on his way to getting them.  He got a 100% and a 90% on two chemistry midterms.  He finds chemistry easy.  Now he realizes that school is really not that hard if you open a book, read it and listen to the professors lecture.  (Isn’t that an amazing concept?) Adam is doing so well in chemistry that he decided to work on his own chemistry project.  He and a friend were hungry for brownies.  It was a seven hour process that included a one hour hike to the store, 10 extra eggs, a mixing bowl that was actually a zip lock bag that could handle excessive squishing, and microwave baking because no real oven could be found.   Adam’s chemistry experiment yielded brownies that were burned in the center, because the microwave bakes inside out.  But, they were the best brownies he ever tasted.</p>
<p>Jasmine is 14 and is in her first year at Granada Hills High School. Jazz has blossomed into a beauty.  If you have not seen Jazz in a while,
you may be surprised. Mornings equal make up.  If it took me as long to put on my makeup and do my hair as it does Jazz, I would never make it
to work.  Of course, she is often late to school. But, it must be worth the effort because she was voted “Best Eyes” in her eighth grade class.
The phone is still permanently attached to her ear and the computer is her constant companion.  She “chats” with more people from more countries
than I knew existed.  Jasmine has great fashion sense. She could shop non-stop for days as long as Mom or Dad were following along behind with
cash or credit card.  She was in 7th Heaven in Hong Kong and Japan.  Nasr worked during the day while Jazz and I shopped.  We spent the majority
of our time in clothing stores. Somehow, the shops that carry my styles don’t carry Jasmine’s clothes.  So, I spent two solid weeks following
Jasmine around small Hong Kong boutiques and massive Japanese department stores.  I don’t want to even guess how much we spent, but it wasn’t in
three digits.  Of course, these clothes are now spread around her room and she cannot wait to shop for her holiday clothes because she has
NOTHING TO WEAR!!   Jazz  says, “I spend all my time either at the mall or at the movies.  I really like snow boarding.  Math sucks, and
Christmas rules.”  This is probably the most conversation I’ve gotten out of her in months.  Consider yourselves blessed.</p>
<p>May the season bless all of you with great happiness and superb health.    And, we pray for a little sanity for those in the Ghoniem household
and for those households blessed with teenagers all over the world.</p>

<p>Greetings of the Season Once Again!</p>
<p>2001 has been a year of personal and national trials.  We’d like to believe that these trials make us stronger, not just a little crazier.</p>
<p>Nasr had a traveled-filled year up until September.  He traveled throughout the United States, as usual, but this year he got the chance to
spend the summer with his family.  The definition of relaxation for Nasr is Alexandria, Egypt.  It means strolling along the Mediterranean Sea,
sounds of laughter from his children, catching up about family and friends with his father and mother, and napping in the afternoon with the
breeze from the Mediterranean wafting across his body. Nasr’s schedule is also a relatively relaxing one. It allows him to teach his classes,
have office hours and work with this research group.  But there are still a lot of hours in the day from 6:00 a.m. to 11:p.m. for him to sit at
his laptop computer and write proposals and books and still come up with lots of ideas for more research. He has also taken on the
responsibility of helping Jasmine.   He has decided he could be a professional high school student. (He’s only helped three of them through!) He
reads the books and then re-teaches the math and chemistry to Jazz.  Too often, I find him curling up with her books every night before he
sleeps because he has to re-learn the way they teach it here.  It’s hard staying one step ahead of your teenage daughter and to try to stay
several steps ahead of the research pack.</p>
<p>Virginia had an eventful year, one of personal health issues and fears.  Thank goodness the health issues were solved by surgery. The nurses at
the hospital informed me that one night I was the super-hero, “Hot-flash,” who destroys the enemy with rays of heat that shoot from her palms.
I tried to demonstrate my powers, but I was too doped up for the rays to work, and unfortunately they gave me new medication the next day.
After surgery you need to recuperate. The best place for that is Egypt. We were fed very well, given transportation and had no responsibilities.
The kids found friends and I saw them for a half an hour a day between 2:00p.m. and 2:30p.m.(Dinner time–their breakfast).  I read books, swam
in the warm, soothing Mediterranean, laughed with friends and did nothing.  I had thoughts of doing something, but I waited 3 minutes and the
thoughts disappeared.  My niece’s wedding in Maine was a great family reunion. Portland barely survived, but we had lots of fun.  The other
guests at the wedding wanted to know if we would “work” other weddings because we certainly know how to get everyone partying.  The bubble juice
may never wash out of my hair, but I certainly had fun flooding my siblings with bubbles. (For some reason, other nieces and nephews are
concerned about inviting all the aunts and uncles to their weddings.)  In between all my adventures, I do manage to be a principal at one of the
high performing schools in California.  It keeps me very busy and Nasr’s favorite thing to say is.  “You are too busy for..” (Just fill in the
blank.)  I always argue that I’m no busier than he is, but after 25 years of marriage, I realize this is an argument that I will never win. But
I did get to retaliate by stuffing cake in his face at our 25th Anniversary party.</p>
<p>Amira, 22, graduated from UCLA as an electrical engineer.
Before she left for Stanford, she spent the summer doing her internship at Aerospace Corporation and visiting Egypt and London. In Egypt she was
sunbathing, night clubbing and “hanging” with her friends until the wee hours of the morning.  As the plane took off for London, she was making
plans for a visit to Egypt in December. (Not this year! Mama says.) In London, Ami took on the responsibility of planning our itinerary.  We
toured the hallowed halls of Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, and the Tower of London.  If Ami wondered what an engineering
degree would get her, I think these castles opened up a few possibilities for her.  Once we returned from our trip, there was a lot of last
minute shopping to get both Ami and Adam ready to move into apartments. I made an executive decision.  Ami got the new things because Adam was
moving in with three other guys.  Moving Ami up to school was tough.  She moved a lot of her things on Thursday, but Nasr and I brought the
remainder on Saturday. We found her surrounded by boxes and computer peripheries unsure if she would have room for it all.  Four of us unpacked
for a day and shopped for another. She is doing quite well.  I am sort of surviving.  Ami has incorporated her Egyptian culture into the
Stanford culture.  Here belly-dancing speech, complete with finger cymbals and veils, got rave reviews. The Phone Company loves Ami.  Between
her calls home and mine to her, the Phone Company will be able to expand into every third world country, by the end of 2001!</p>
<p>Adam, 19, is in his second year at Santa Barbara.  It was touch and go for a while at the end of his first year, but he has pulled himself up by
the bootstraps and is doing very well. I think sleeping in a van with two flat tires while he was on spring break made him realize being a bum
isn’t glamorous. He figured getting an engineering degree is a lot easier than not having a roof over your head. While visiting friends, Adam
and two other guests got locked out on a balcony overlooking a large hill.  The owners of the house were asleep downstairs and being a
thoughtful guest, Adam did not want to wake them up.  He decided to take action by throwing a rock. Not through the door, but over the balcony.
He measured the time it took to reach the ground. He then put together an equation based on the rock time, his height, including the length of
his very long arms. (Adam was the tallest–or maybe the others didn’t want to put their life into Adam’s equation.)  Based on this formula, he
decided he could drop off the balcony and not break his legs.  It worked.  His legs are intact and his friends are no longer stuck on the
balcony. Adam will never say “Why am I studying physics?  I will never use it in real life.”  You may want to tell this true story to get your
kids to study physics.</p>
<p>Jasmine at 15 is into driving.  She had her first behind the wheel driving experience in driving rain. She wants to take her permit test before
she has finished with her driver education classes.  Why is Mom so mean? No one else finishes the classes before they take the test! Once Nasr
brings Jasmine home from school, she runs for the phone and talks to her friends while munching on a snack.  As soon as Nasr figures she has had
enough conversation with her friends, he calls her on his very first cell phone.   Nasr finally entered the 21st century. With call waiting,
Jazz won’t miss any phone call. She picks up the line and Nasr calmly tells her she needs to start studying.  It works quite well and it saves
Nasr’s throat and lungs from unnecessary torment. Jazz is back to doing her artwork.  She makes beautiful faces of characters and we have her
acrylic water scene hung on the wall.  This year Jasmine is doing so well in school.  I am not complaining, but the child we had last year is
not the child we have this year.  I think aliens took her last year and gave us someone that we did not know.  This summer, they brought our
wonderful Jazzy back to us.  We are so happy and I believe she is, too.</p>
<p>The emergency number 911 has taken on a new meaning for everyone in the United States.  Everyone suffered.  Muslim Americans felt the painful
brunt of stereotyping and we all felt the frustration of being unable to help those you love. Let’s pray for better years to come.  Happy
Holidays! God Bless America!  And to quote someone who dealt with adversity and challenge, “God Bless Us All, Everyone!”</p>

<h2>December 2002<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2002" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>As I begin to write this letter, the world is in a troubled time and I wonder if the world is ever not troubled.  So it is during this holiday
season that I hope I can add some cheer and laughter to our daily lives.</p>
<p>Nasr started travelling again this year.  He travelled to London and Egypt with Ami and then later to Switzerland. Most would be very jealous of
his schedule.  He says he is working, but he never leaves the house until 10 a.m.  He claims this is because he is trying to beat the traffic.
His self-proclaimed title is “big time manager in charge of research,” but for the rest of us, he’s an absent-minded professor. On the days he
works at home, he exercises, and then enjoys lunch and coffee out.  He believes these 3 hours out are the same 3 hours he would spend in
traffic.  (Who believes that?) Nasr loves to make things last-particularly his cars.  This year we had an option of buying a car for Jazz or for
Nasr.  Of course, he was going to be a martyr and buy one for Jazz.  I stepped in and made some noise.  He always buys for others before
himself.  I quietly (ok, not so quietly) convinced him that he needed to buy a new car.  He consulted his car expert friends and thought and
thought and thought some more. Finally, one day we saw an ad in the paper, drove to the dealer, and then drove home in a new Mercedes.  Nasr
loves his “glider” as he calls it.  Now he wonders why he always gave the kids new cars and never bought one for himself.   We are moving into
the ultra modern era of computers being networked. We both sit in the same room with Nasr on the couch and Virginia at the desk, but we don’t
have to use our voices. We merely email messages back and forth to each other.  So many people have complained that the art of letter writing is
gone. The Ghoniems are back to letter writing, however, we just might be losing the art of conversation.</p>
<p>Virginia who was blessed with being born into the best, most supportive, family in the world lost her car at the same moment that she was
writing this letter.  (No, not her marbles, her car.) A teenager was driving much too fast down the street and my poor Acura took the brunt of
the crash. At least Nasr was home.  However, when Nasr travels, the animals are in the house to keep me company. (Shh-don’t tell Nasr.) When the
kids were little, I never had a free moment.  I couldn’t even use the restroom without company.  Well, the animals have the same craving to keep
“Mom” company.  The two cats are usually fighting-one can open the door, so she comes in to complain, then, the other cat pounces on the first.
Meanwhile, the dog mills about my feet, silently begging me to make them stop fighting.  It’s great to be loved, but there is a reason why kids
grow up and hopefully move out.  Nasr was on a business trip in Switzerland. (Why do things always happen when he travels?) I had just finished
a grueling 6-hour drive from Stanford.  It was midnight and I merely wanted to sleep because the Monday morning alarm would sound at 5 a.m.  As
I walked up the steps, Jazz asked me, “Why are there two holes in the wall next to Adam’s door?  Too tired to do anything but shake my head, I
walked into Adam’s room and calmly asked, “Why?” His reply was simple, “I got mad.” It surprised me how calmly I responded, “Next time don’t
take it out on the wall and call someone to get it fixed before your dad gets back from Switzerland.”  As the week went on, I gave Adam gentle
reminders and then not so gentle reminders to get it fixed-if you have teenagers you can relate. Suddenly it was Saturday morning, Nasr was
coming back on Sunday, and I still had two giant holes in my wall.  Saturdays are my day at the beauty salon. The manicurist, who has a pulse on
the world, was listening to me complain about my week, when I meekly asked if she knew of anyone who can fix dry wall. Her face lit up as she
exclaimed, “ I sure do.”  A few phone calls later and some deft maneuvering with the phone (I can’t mess up my nails) I had a painter scheduled
to come to the house at 2 p.m. By that evening, no one would have guessed I’d had two six inch holes in the wall.  Adam came home just as the
painter was leaving and mumbled thanks. His problem was solved!  The moral of this story is: If you ever have a problem, don’t write to Dear
Abby, visit your local beauty salon and all your cosmetic problems will be solved, hair, nails and dry wall.</p>
<p>Ami is almost 23, and is in graduate school at Stanford.  Unfortunately for our bank account, Ami still has the travel bug.  She went to Egypt
this summer with her Dad and enjoyed spending time with her friends.  (Ami would go to Egypt every 6 months as long as Mom and Dad foot the
bill.)  We never paid Ami for getting good grades, but somehow she convinces us that since she is doing so well in school, the appropriate
gesture is to pay for her travel.  I can usually agree, but this kid wants to travel more than Gulliver.  She hasn’t been to Colorado to visit
her Uncle Steve, but she did meet up with him and his wife, Gayle, in London.  Ami knows London well and became a tour guide. Ami has a new beau
who lives in Santa Monica.  Don’t forget Ami’s school is in Palo Alto.  Long distance relationships create a very healthy economy.  The money
they spend on long distance phone calls, airline tickets and gas-especially along Highway 5 will keep the California economy strong.  Maybe I
should suggest this idea to Mr. Bush-his other ideas are just as harebrained! (Oops, got a little political.)  Ami will be completing her first
Masters next quarter.  Then, she will continue working on her second Masters.  If you think Ami enjoys being a perpetual student because she
wants to travel, you may be right. However, the bigger problem is that Ami has a fear of work. Let me explain, she is not afraid of hard work,
she is afraid of not having enough time to play.  However, being a good mother, I knew I had to help her get rid of her fear.  Therefore, I
lied.  I told her that work is fun, almost like playing.  I also said gainfully employed people get to take LONG two-week vacations and after a
few years they get an ENDLESS three weeks off.  Unfortunately, she caught on and still doesn’t want to work.  But, if she stays a perpetual
student at Stanford, Nasr and I will be in an economic crisis.</p>
<p>Adam is 20 ½ and is gainfully employed. He is working in the bio-medical field as a lab technician.  Adam has come to the conclusion that money
is the root of all evil-it is especially evil when you don’t have enough. (Anyone else ever have the same thought?)  Adam, also, is a great
dancer.  He shows us his moves that look more like acrobatics and laughs at his dad’s cool, barely moving, minimalist routine.  I tell Adam that
we used to win dance contests and claim his dancing ability comes from his mom.  He smiles and pats me on the head and thinks, “Mom, you’ve
become senile in your old age.”  Adam has taken up a new hobby-learning to be a disc jockey. He has 2 turntables, equalizers, woofers and
sub-woofers and plays loud, pounding music with intermittent scratching sounds.  The kids say it’s music, I have another term for it.  Adam, is
coming to the realization that he is becoming more like his father.  On one level he thinks this is good because “you want to be an intelligent
successful guy like dad.” (I wish Nasr had been here to hear that instead of “working” in Washington D.C. It just isn’t the same hearing a
compliment second hand.) On the other hand, Adam’s very nervous that he uses the same terminology as his dad.  One evening, Adam, his girlfriend
and I went to rent a movie.  Adam was busy complaining that he had to work hard all week and that he was tired. (Those are Nasr’s exact words
every Friday night.)  Adam said he hoped he could stay awake during the entire movie.  I laughed and told them that Nasr has the same problem.
Then, I explained that Nasr’s reason that he sleeps during the movie is that he is so relaxed around me, he just can’t stay awake.  Adam’s
girlfriend’s eyes grew very wide.  “No way!” she exclaimed. “That is exactly what Adam tells me when he falls asleep during a movie.”   Is this
a genetic issue-like father like son?  Or is it a gender thing and women just have more stamina than men do?   Let me know your opinions.</p>
<p>Jasmine is driving and driving me nuts as only a 16-year-old can.  Jasmine has always been into make-up. You should see her huge two feet long
make up case—I’m not exaggerating—that is stuffed with make-up.  If she has all this, can you please tell me why, why, why does she need to
go into my meager stash of make-up, use it up or take it into her bathroom?  Then at 6:00 a.m. when I’m trying to make myself look human for
work, I have to go searching for my makeup or pound on her door, screaming over the throbbing bass of her radio, “Where’s my makeup?”  Nasr
rolls his eyes, covers his ears and says I should lock my makeup in the safe and take it out every morning so he doesn’t have to listen to me
getting so upset. Ladies, do you want to go to the safe to get your make up? Yes, I will continue to rant and rave until she leaves mine alone.
Now, that said, Jasmine is a very good makeup artist.  Whenever she does my makeup, people keep looking at my face and tell me I look really
good. (Maybe she makes me look like someone else, but at least I look good.)  If you want your makeup done, talk to Jazz, but please plan on it
taking a LONG time.  I usually spend 5 minutes (I know it’s obvious), but she will take 40 minutes or more.  Like many artists, Jazz is a
perfectionist when it comes to her art.  Oh, if you are a member of my generation, be prepared for her to complain about your droopy, gooey,
rubbery, eyelids that move when she applies the liner. (It’s tough to take the abuse but definitely worth it.)  I get my revenge because I’ve
discovered what really grosses Jazz out.  Nasr and I love to go for walks at night and quite often we invite Jazz to go along.  However, she has
specific rules for us.  We may not hold hands while we are walking, and oooohh, don’t ever think about kissing each other.  So, if you do catch
a glimpse of us, Jazz is usually walking ahead of us and we sneak our hand holding when she’s not looking.  Of course, when we are feeling
particularly ornery, we hold hands right in front of her, just out of pure parental spite and gleefully watch her squirm.</p>
<p>This past summer my dear sister, Susie, succumbed to ovarian cancer.  No one in my family can understand why Susie had to die so young.  I’ve
come to the conclusion that God needed another angel.  Next time you meet a quiet, creative, cat loving, person with a beautiful smile who finds
it easy to laugh, think of Susie.  And this holiday season when you hear a bell ringing, it IS Susie getting her wings.</p>
<p>Too often this holiday season I’m awakened by the pitter patter of little feet running across the room, then a hiss, a growl, a little more
pitter patter, the clicking of the blinds, another hiss and growl.  Nasr mumbles disgustedly,  “Why are the cats in here? You know I have
asthma. Can’t YOU do something?” Suddenly, the radio clicks on to a melodic, sweet, voice singing, “There’s no place like home for the
holidays.”  I reach out, hit the snooze button, and throw the pillow over my head to drown out the growling and think, “That’s the truth!”</p>
<p>This year has been filled with lots of laughter and far too many tears.  We all pray for peace, happiness, good health and long life for all our
dear friends and family.</p>

<section id="december-2003">
<h2>December 2003<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2003" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving and today our bellies are stuffed and our souls are overflowing with thankfulness for our wonderful friends and
family.  Soooo, I cranked up the Christmas music (Nasr said not to play it too loudly-I ignored him) and I decided this was the perfect time to
expound on why we are so thankful.  (It may make you thankful that you don’t have to deal with our trials and tribulations.)</p>
<p>Amira (24-or oh so close) (Pretty soon I’m going to stop posting their ages because there are too many smart people out there who can do the
math about our ages.)  This has been a very exciting year for Amira.  Nasr and I are particularly excited because as of May she is fully and
gainfully employed and quite an independent young lady.  (Ok, so they are never completely financially independent, but we are paying a lot less
of her everyday bills.)  In June, she earned her Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford. The ceremony was spectacular.  I don’t
know who was more proud, Amira or Nasr. While she was a student, Amira met a fine, handsome, young man, Matthew Koerner.  He is also an
electrical engineer and works in the same company as Amira.  Matt recognized what we already knew, and Amira realized that she found a good man.
On October 3, 2003, Matt proposed and surprise surprise, Amira accepted.  Once they told us, we were jumping for joy and then suddenly it hit
us.  WE HAVE TO PLAN A WEDDING!   The first thought was to have a June wedding.  Amira wanted to relax and enjoy being engaged-and I heard the
clock ticking  (actually it was banging) and I could feel all the venues for a ceremony and reception hurriedly slamming the doors in our faces.
We found some spectacular places and were they spectacularly expensive!  Finally, the young couple found the most perfect place to get married.
They are getting married in a castle garden in Beverly Hills and partying in a penthouse overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the sparkling lights
of Los Angeles.  And if you think this is happening in June, think again.  The wedding is set for September 19, 2004.  Next year, I’ll fill you
in on the trials and tribulations of a wedding. (We are already talking to our friends who will make sure we don’t make the same mistakes they
did, but I’m sure, we’ll make new ones.)</p>
<p>Adam (21) has decided he wants to compete in the Mr. Universe contest. (Only kidding!)  But, he has gotten on the exercise bandwagon. This
summer, he encouraged Nasr and I to get on our bikes at 5:00 a.m. and ride 4 miles one way to the gym, then we worked out for an hour and then
proceeded to ride our bikes back home for another 4 miles.  For Adam it was easy, for Nasr and I it was exhausting, but boy did we feel a sense
of accomplishment as we huffed and puffed our way uphill.  In the process, Adam is building muscles and sculpting his body.  He has been
attending college and working in the engineering department at UCLA.   Adam is slowly taking on the cleaning traits of his father. Almost every
morning one can hear the loud, disgusted, frustrated, voice of Adam as he tells Jasmine that she needs to clean up the bathroom.  He admits that
he has 1/10 of his father’s neatness bug, but he figures that when he gets be his dad’s age, he will be just like him. (I’ll make sure that I
warn his future wife.) Money continues to burn a hole in Adam’s pocket. I think when Adam was young and Nasr explained the difference between
saving and spending, Adam mixed them up. Even though he can’t save a dime, he has an overabundance of patriotism and wants to help his country.
His patriotism mixed with all the exercise helped him decide to join the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves.  He will be leaving for Boot Camp on
December 15th and Nasr and I will be in San Diego  in March to see his ceremonious graduation where he will be marching to a different drummer.
Our cats bring many interesting and unusual gifts to us, but last night Luna carried a small ornament-wrapped like a gift-to Adam’s room.  Does
she know Adam won’t be home for Christmas?  I told Adam this “gift” would bring him good luck. But, there’s no way I’ll unwrap it, because Luna
is a very mischievous cat.</p>
<p>Jasmine (17) is in her senior year in high school.  (Need I say anything more?)  Can you believe that little Jasmine is going to be finishing
high school this year? She can’t wait to turn 18 and move out. (You know what I’m not saying, don’t you.) She is taking a very light load
academically, but she is taking on a very heavy load in the work world.  She continues to be a sandwich artist at Subway.  She is learning that
earning minimum wage is not what she wants to do and it is encouraging her to want to do well in college. (However, she hasn’t connected
studying in high school as a precursor to doing well in college.)  As all children in their senior year, Jazz is expected to make some major
decisions about her life-like what will she study?  What will she want to do when she has finished college?  She made it to the “D’s” in the
alphabet.  Right now it is a choice between a dentist and a designer.  Clothes with designer labels are the only clothes that Jasmine will buy.
Now that she is working, she does have money to spend.  We try to tell her that she wants to save money to buy a car.  (The car she is driving
is 10 years old.) However, like her brother, she does not see the value of saving.  She does however, see the value of a name.  Like Jasmine, I
have to admit the designer  names of Von Dutch and Bebe make me shake.  But, Jazz is shaking with excitement, while I’m shaking trying to not
strangle my daughter for paying $300.00 for a jogging suit with a suggestive word written across the derriere.  Jasmine has a specific, subtle,
sense of beauty.  I will agree that everyone feels certain parts of his or her body can accentuate how good you look.  However, for Jasmine, she
is totally paralyzed and cannot go anywhere, or even take a shower, if her eyebrows are not perfectly shaped or groomed.  Jazz says, “Eyebrows
are everything and if they are shaggy or grown out, you look disgusting, just ask anyone.”  So I’m asking.  Are eyebrows everything?  Where was
I when the fashion people decided that eyebrows were the most important feature on the human body?  Maybe it all goes back to the beginning,
Jasmine is a senior in high school.  Need I say more?</p>
<p>Virginia (Glad she is older than 17-not admitting to much more) is planning a wedding and she will not have anything else on her mind for the
next year.  (ARRGGGHHH)   I am calm about the whole thing, but don’t ask Amira or Nasr because they have very different views on how calm is
expressed.  Ok, I am working, so I guess I will have a few more things on my mind. (At least during working hours.) I have changed schools and
now I am the principal at a school only 6 minutes from my house. (I have to be very careful that I change that part of the letter when I mail it
to my friends in Los Angeles because most people commute much further.)  Not only am I closer, I got a raise-hey what a deal! (Thanks Boss!)
The biggest perk about moving to the new school is that I got the chance to meet Kirk Douglas.  I shook his hand, I introduced him to the crowd
and I have to tell you, he is a very wonderful, genuine, human being.  And, (sorry Nasr) even at his age, he is still very handsome.  I grew up
watching Kirk Douglas on the big screen and I can attest that he is one man that didn’t need any special make-up.  There was one point a few
weeks ago when Nasr was getting a little worried when I was wearing a picture of Kirk on my forehead.  But he has relaxed a little, now that I
moved Kirk to the refrigerator.  This summer Nasr and I escaped-oops I mean, traveled to Colorado to see my brother, Steve and his wife, Gayle.
We did the usual strenuous exercise of lifting our hands from the plate to our mouths while laughing and having a good time, but Gayle and I
decided to be even more adventurous and go for a horseback ride in the Rocky Mountains.  (It was supposed to be a flat ride along the river.)
However, it turned out to be a two-hour ride straight UP and straight DOWN the mountain.  Now I know why the cowboys hug their horses.  They
aren’t really hugging them, they are hanging on for dear life because their horse is going up a mountain goat trail.  Yes, I rode UP this
unbelievably steep mountain goat trail.  Then, when the horse was taking a nosedive down the mountain, I laid back on its back and prayed to God
that I would make it out of there. Hey, if I can ride those mountains at my age, and not fall off the horse, I can do anything.  I can even plan
a wedding.  Adam got Nasr and I started on the morning exercise.  Nasr and I still get up at 5:00 and work out for an hour.  (We work, so we
have to use horsepower instead of leg power-i.e. we drive instead of ride bike.)  But, we both enjoy it.  Adam, however, lost interest in the
early morning exercise.  He has changed his exercise to the evenings.  I think he figures he’ll get enough exercise early in the morning in the
Marines.</p>
<p>Nasr, (I promised not to make a comment regarding his advanced age this year. Oops, was that a comment?) is taking on new responsibilities all
the time.  He is father of the bride, Vice Chairman of his department, traveling, running a large lab, supervising 20 students, teaching two
classes, traveling, chauffeuring Adam to wherever he wants to go, and trying to put together a business. (He and Adam are making BIG plans for
the future.)  Do I see my husband?  Occasionally.  Actually, Adam and Nasr see a great deal of each other.  Adam does not drive so this has
given Adam and Nasr a great opportunity to bond.  Nasr may complain about how busy he is, but he thoroughly enjoys the long talks and talk of
dreams that he and Adam share on the long ride to UCLA and Pierce College.  Did you note that I wrote Father of the Bride first?  Nasr and I see
our roles differently.  I see the wedding taking up all my energy, Nasr sees it as an exercise in check writing. He thinks he will have to go to
the gym twice a day to lift weights so he can handle the burden. (I made the mistake of taking him to the Ritz to help me price the meal.  He
has almost recovered.)   Yes, Nasr traveled again this summer.  As usual he had a great time in Egypt with his family.  He also went to Greece
and spent a day on a Greek Island.  (Oh yes, this was one of his conferences from which he comes home very exhausted from all the work.) A group
of scientists from America, Greece, Egypt, China, Russia and Spain decided to play hooky from the conference.  Luckily they had a Greek with
them who was their tour guide.  They toured the ancient birthplace of Alexander the Great in Macadonia, swam in the warm, turquoise-blue water
of the Mediterranean, and then had a traditional fish lunch, interspersed with laughter, intellectual thought and relaxing drinks.  They
continued their tour of the Helkidikki peninsula where they saw ancient ruins and picturesque mountains, swam in a secluded water inlet and felt
the warm Mediterranean breeze waft over them.  As the day grew to an end and they watched the lights of the ships, and the nestled homes
twinkling beneath them, the group decided that they had all experienced the perfect day.   Never, EVER, feel sorry for Nasr when he says he has
to travel.</p>
<p>As the year comes to a close, and we all remember the good, the bad, and the not so pretty, it is our hope that next year all our friends get
the chance to experience their perfect day over and over again.  I hope your holidays are special and you have a very Happy and Healthy New
Year!</p>

<h2>December 2004<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2004" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>Again, I sit here listening to Christmas carols telling myself that I need to start writing the yearly
letter.  I sat down to write the letter over an hour ago, but I got sidetracked by looking at the
wedding pictures.  And that pretty much sums up the yearI got sidetracked by the wedding, but
wow what a wedding.</p>
<p>Nasr–the father of the bridewas a typical father. He tried to rein in the expenses, by asking if
we really needed this or that, but one look at his daughters pleading eyes and he melted and
succumbed to spending more money.  I dont think all the wedding planning and commotion
affected him until about two weeks before the actual wedding.  You realize he took over 25 trips
this year and the year isn’t over, yet.   Do you think one of the reasons he traveled so much was
because he was avoiding the wedding planning?  You get to guess the answer for that one.  On
top of the wedding, Nasr is focused on the news from the Middle East.  This has been a year of
dichotomies and the year of the W.  When Nasr and I walk, I speak of Amira and weddings and
Nasr talks of Adam and weapons.</p>
<p>Virginia–this is the year she turned the F word.  Now, take your mind out of the gutter.  Think
age!   I thought turning this large number would be very difficult.  However, Nasr helped soften
the blow by taking me on a 7 day Caribbean cruise with our dear friends. So, when the day
actually arrived, I was dancing the night away and swimming in the warm tropical seas.  I think
every birthday should be met with such exuberance and a cruise.  Nasr is a little concerned about
the cruise part of that statement again he is thinking about the money aspect of it.  I got a
chance travel with Nasr on a couple of his trips this year.  After the cruise, we traveled to New
Hampshire and then to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  You do realize that 65% of all gems are mined in
Brazil.  Yes, I found a very special gem to bring home. Dont feel sorry for Nasr, you havent
seen the women on the beaches of Brazil and you know Nasr never passes up an opportunity to
go to the beach!  Oh, on top everything else, I had gall bladder surgery that had me laid up for
about 6 hours.  Don’t tell the doctor he thought I actually recuperated.  But who had time?  I
had to put on a wedding in four weeks!  Oh, and besides that, school was starting in two weeks!</p>
<p>Amira was married on September 19 to Matthew Allen Koerner on the grounds of the Doheny
mansion in Beverly Hills.  Yes, it was every bit as beautiful and romantic as it sounds.  Amira and
Matthew worked very hard to create the most spectacular wedding and focused on every detail
from the invitations, programs, parasols, and homemade rose petal baskets to all the banquet
items.  The stress level in the house was a little high especially as Amira was working full time
up to two days before the wedding.  The most difficult part of her job was the 40 mile commute
one way.  When traffic was bad, which happens about every day, she would come home in a
mood that bordered on hysteria.   (Matthew has seen it, so this letter is not giving away any
horrible secrets.) So, if Mom forgot to wait for the appropriate time for her to calm down before
asking her to make some decisions about the wedding,—-ooooooh it really got ugly.   Planning a
wedding is the most wonderful thing to do with your daughter, but folks, it also is one of the most
stressful things a mother and daughter need to do together.   I didnt want to make decisions that I
felt she should make (it was her wedding) and she didn’t think about anything because she was
too stressed.  As we were returning from the bridal dress shop (a long, long drive), I asked Amira
to get a piece of paper so she could write down a list of things I needed to buy.  (Its not a good
idea to drive and write at the same time.) I named a few items like ribbons and boxes and walkie
talkies.  Suddenly, Amira stopped writing, her eyes were wide with fear, and she looked at me
like I sprouted antennas from my head.  Mom, you are not.  I laughed and then calmly
assured her that the walkie talkies were for the school, not for the wedding.  She had visions of
her mother using the walkie talkies during the ceremony.  (I wouldnt, but the coordinators made
good use of theirs.)  A few days before the wedding, I finally convinced Amira that I needed one
hour of her time.  She kept putting me off because I think she was afraid I was going to tell her
she was an adopted child. Once we sat down together, I assured her that she wasn’t adopted and
gave her a book with stories about my mother, myself and her.  We cried and laughed and grew a
little closer.  By the time the newly weds made their grand entrance into the reception behind the
belly dancer sporting a candelabra on her head, we all knew that every little detail that seemed so
unimportant at the time, had created a wedding made for our princess, Amira.  Not only did the
newlyweds dance to the Frank Sinatra tune, The Best is Yet to Come, they belly danced with
young and old, Mid-Westerners and Middle Easterners. Now, that is sight to see!!!</p>
<p>Adam was one of the groomsmen for the wedding.   Last Christmas he was in Marine boot camp
and we were trying to find a date for the wedding when we knew Adam was going to be home.<br />
He finished boot camp in March, but he continued training in Oklahoma until the end of June.  He
is well trained to do things that a mother doesn’t want to know about.  Adam enjoyed the training,
once he was out of boot camp.  He is an Artilleryman which means he knows how to shoot the
BIG guns.  When Nasr and I went to visit him in Oklahoma and we had a chance to see these
very large weapons.  Adam was explaining that they practice for speed.  The reason they practice
for speed is because once they shoot their big gun, (8000 pounds) they have three minutes to
move it because the other side is going to shoot back with their big guns to the same spot.   That
is something a mother doesn’t want to hear.  Once he finished his training, several of his Marine
friends came to the house for a party.  They were drinking and partying way into the night.<br />
Suddenly, I was awakened at 3 a.m. by several inebriated men shouting. Kill, Kill, Kill.  (That
is something a mother doesn’t want to hear or have the neighbors hear.)   While Adam was in
training, his gear was stowed and the area near his rack (bed for us non-military speaking
people) had to be kept spotless or he couldn’t go to the mess (food) hall.  After he came home,
he kept his room looking quite good.  But, when he moved into his apartment, he slept in a mess
and made a wreck of his bed.  That is something a mother doesn’t want to see.  Cleaning that
apartment will not be for the faint of heart it will take someone with great courage.  I think Ill
call in the Marine to take care of it.   Adam is one of the few men who is willing to sign up to
protect our country.  Unfortunately, they changed his specialty from artillery to infantry.  He was
telling me that he now carries a big gun and he will be protecting the convoys.  That is something
a mother doesnt want to hear.  Now, he is scheduled to go to Iraq in August of 2005.  That is
definitely something a mother doesn’t want to hear.</p>
<p>Jasmine was the Maid of Honor.  Jazz was a maid of honor who delegated all of  her
responsibilities to another bridesmaid.   She did show up for the weddng and she was beautiful.
Jasmine is in her first year at California State University, Northridge.  She is working towards a
degree in graphic arts.   She is truly an artist in every sense of the word.  Jasmine was working at
Subway and she has a bit of a problem getting to work early or even getting there on time.  One
afternoon, she flew out the door and not 10 minutes later, she called and said she forgot her shoes.<br />
How do you forget your shoes?  When you are dressed in a work uniform shouldnt that include
shoes?  Don’t you need shoes to drive?  She didn’t have time for me to ask questions, she merely
wanted me to find her shoes and when she honked I should throw the shoes into the window so
she didnt really have to stop.   On her return flyby, she slowed down and I tossed the shoes
through the window and she was off to work.   However, she does realize that she needs to multi-
task in order to get to her 11 a.m. class on time. The other day Nasr and I were frantically
searching for OUR toothpaste in OUR bathroom.  Finally, I went out and bought some.  The next
morning I found the toothpaste in the shower where Jazz was multi-tasking.  Do you brush your
teeth in the shower?   Jazz has her ears pierced in several places and when we came back from the
Caribbean, she was sporting a nose ring.  My first nasty thought was I hoped she got a really bad
runny nose so she would take it out.  She never got a runny nose, but I noticed it was gone a few
weeks ago.  So, yesterday, Thanksgiving Day, I was busy running around trying to make dinner
for 20 people and asking her for help.  She hemed and hawed and escaped the kitchen.  Then
suddenly, as I was taking the stuffing out of the oven she matter of factly informed me that she
has a belly button ring and she has had her belly pierced since she was 16!  Shes proud that she
kept it a secret for 2 years and she was telling me now because she is 18 and there is nothing I can
do about it.   Its true, she is 18, but that has nothing to do with the fact that I did not murder her
on the spot.  The 20 HUNGRY witnesses saved her life.</p>
<p>I hope that the New Year doesnt bring any piercing surprises for anyoneeven if they are of
age.  This year, as every year, I want to wish everyone a Happy, Healthy and Peaceful New Year.<br />
However, this year, more than any year, praying for Peace on Earth is more important than ever
before.</p>

<h2>December 2005<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2005" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Greetings of the Season!</p>
<p>This has been a year of joy, pride and fear.  It’s a quiet Sunday afternoon when I get to write this
letter, and as usual I am listening to Christmas carols on the radio, and enjoying a chocolate kiss or two
(but who’s counting?).  The difference is that this year, I know Adam won’t be home for the holidays and
I am saying an extra prayer for him and all  our young people in uniform who won’t be home either, but
WILL be home soon.</p>
<p>Nasr has been to Europe three times in four months, a little bit of Madrid, Prague, Paris and
Copenhagen with an excursion or two to Egypt. While visiting Egypt, he discovered Trianon.  It is a
Danish bakery established in the 1600’s that recently opened a caf   just blocks from our home in
Alexandria, Egypt.  So this time, Nasr “worked” at the bakery while overlooking the Mediterranean,
drinking cappuccinos and eating tasty pastries.  How many people want his job? On one of our joint trips,
we stopped for lunch at an airport, and for the first time Nasr was asked for his identification-just to
make sure he was old enough to imbibe. He is closer to the big six and yet, this was the first for him.  He
looked dumbfounded and it took him a while to realize the waitress was serious. But I think it went to his
head because now he spends more time in front of the mirror believing his spot is shrinking.  It’s
November and all the new electronic toys have come out and Nasr, as usual, bought the newest toys for
himself.  This year he purchased a computer phone.  It is about 3” by 5” and it holds all his contacts,
calendar, email, PhD presentations, international presentations-oh, and it also is a phone.  Make Nasr
happy and call him on his new toy.  He keeps it turned on all the time, not like previous phones.   818
825-0244.</p>
<p>Virginia did Sweden!  This year I accompanied Nasr to one of his conferences. (He tries to tell me that
conferences are boring.  He’s lying!  They are lots of fun-especially a dinner cruise on a Danish fiord.)
While he was actually working during the day, I met Helen Singh and Jean Bacon and we had a Spouses
Spectacular Spontaneous Swedish Spree.  The swift ferry ride, the scenic countryside, the immaculately
groomed gardens and the gourmet dishes of the fishing villages was capped on the ride home, by the
spectacular view from the bridge that overlooks Denmark.  Nasr has never been to Sweden.  Of course, I
won’t name all the countries that he has visited that I haven’t-but I have Sweden.  This year I learned
that there is one job that is hazardous to my health.  I was washing dishes and  just as I was  reaching to
put the clean dishes in the drainer, my back suddenly cramped.  I couldn’t move for days! (Of course,
Nasr was on one of his trips.)  It wouldn’t let up so it required many trips to the chiropractor.  Moral of
this story-if you don’t want to hurt yourself, don’t do dishes.  Somehow this year Nasr has gotten into
the season very early and has purchased my gifts before Christmas.  He has redone our bedroom and for
the first time in 30 years, I have a NEW bedroom set.  OOOOH, it is very pretty and very luxurious.  He
also bought “me” a new Plasma TV.  If you think that he bought the TV for me, then the diamond that
I’m buying next week is for Nasr. (Don’t tell Nasr, it is a secret.)   Besides, do presents that arrive before
Christmas day count as Christmas presents?</p>
<p>Amira (soon to be 26) and Matthew celebrated their first wedding anniversary this September.  One of
the benefits of married life is that Amira has become a very accomplished cook.  Almost all of her recipes
are from Martha Stewart.  She is addicted to watching the food channel. At least Matt doesn’t have to
listen to tales about mom’s cooking, only Martha’s cooking.  They are very active and athletic. (This is
why Amira can make these great meals and they both stay so slim.) They run, swim, bicycle and one of
their favorite sports is hiking. When Nasr travels these two, very kindly, make sure that I am not alone or
lonely.  One Sunday afternoon, they decided they would take me on a hike in Will Roger’s State Park.
When we first drove in we saw a lively game of Polo with fast moving horses and flying mallets.  I
figured this had to be high class hiking-so nothing too strenuous.  This will be an easy afternoon.  Amira
knows that I do not like heights, so she “prepared” me for this hike by showing me the bridge that
traversed a canyon that we were going to cross.  I was going to be tough-if I didn’t like it, I could close
my eyes and they could lead me across. (Yes, I trust them that much.) Surprisingly, the bridge was a piece
of cake to cross.  The unbelievably steep, downhill, limb filled, deeply eroded, foliage covered path was
strenuous.  Getting lost eight or nine times, sliding down the bank on my derri  re, passing animal
skeletons hanging on some old ruins,  swinging Tarzan style on the hanging vines, and traipsing through
ankle deep creek water all while “following” Amira and Matthew, the experienced hikers, was
exhausting, demanding, laborious and backbreaking.  Amira stayed brave for me.  I stayed brave because
it is very embarrassing losing your cool in front of your son-in-law and somehow (hallelujah) we made it
out.  Now that Nasr is back, they are talking about taking us both hiking.  Do you think we should go, or
just stick to the Polo games?  Amira and Matthew are taking a long vacation (3 months) so they can travel
and see the U.S. before they start their new jobs in Washington D.C.  I can talk about it now because they
are still only 30 miles away.  It will be a different story when they are 3000 miles away.  But, I will
behave like Scarlet O’Hara and I will think about that tomorrow.  I am sure you will hear about it in my
next letter. (Look for tears on the paper.)</p>
<p>Adam at 23 is a Marine fighting in Fallouja, Iraq. We don’t get to hear from him very often, but we
write a lot of letters.  It has been over two weeks since we’ve heard from him.  I am hoping once the
elections are over that things will calm down a bit.  He did learn some Iraqi Arabic and is using it to
communicate with the people there.  The part he likes about being there is giving the educational gifts and
toys to the kids.  He says the kids are really sweet. Earlier this year, when he was in between jobs because
of the uncertainty of going to war, he called me at work to say hello.  Not two minutes later, my cell
phone rang and Jazz was on the line.  I was trying to talk to both at the same time. Since neither of them
wanted to wait, they both popped the question simultaneously of why they had called.  “Mom, do you
have any money?”  Both phones. Both children. Same question.  When you are out of funds, just call the
Bank of MOM.  (Yes, I was a sucker and they both got money.)   Adam called several weeks ago with a<br />
good story from Iraq.  He said this was something to put in the Christmas letter.  It gets very cold at night
and he and another Marine (both from Los Angeles) had checkpoint duty.  The heater went out and it was
really cold.  They do not have coats to wear over their uniforms so they have to find creative ways to stay
warm.  Adam said he and his fellow Marine used pieces of an old shack to start a fire.  He used his Boy
Scout training to start a fire with no matches.  He didn’t elaborate, but I think he used methods that Boy
Scouts don’t use.  The most important part of the story-he warmed up on a very cold night.</p>
<p>Jasmine at 19 is attending the local university and trying to decide what she wants to do with her life.<br />
At the present, she is living in a house with three other girls.  Since she cannot afford to be out of touch
with anyone she was devastated when her cell phone was stolen.  At considerable cost to Mom, (learn
from my mistakes, get cell phone insurance-it is much cheaper), I managed to get her phone replaced.<br />
Now, with a new phone you must put the right message on the phone.  It was a simple message, but it had
to be perfect.  She paced as she created the message.  While in the bathroom, the message sounded too
angry. So she moved to her room to try it.  No,  it didn’t sound right.  Finally, while sitting in her closet
behind a closed door, she voiced her message over and over and over until she got it just right-the right
words, the right tone, the right feeling.   Can you imagine what her papers would look like if she put that
much effort into making them sound just right?   To keep her company in the house of 4 girls and many
visitors, Jazz decided that she needed to get a kitty.  So, she brought home a black cat from the animal
shelter and named it “Chicken.”   She has her reasons, but I keep begging her to change the name-she
won’t.  I am sure my dad is sorely disappointed in me.    He raised me on a farm and now my daughter
doesn’t even know a cat from a chicken.   Now, Jasmine got the cat to keep her company.  However, as
there are a lot of people at her house, she was worried about the cat and brought her over here so we could
watch her for a couple of days.  Well, the cat, has been here for a month and every time I suggest that Jazz
take her home, she kisses me and says, but don’t you like the cat, mom?  Now, I am a grandmother of a
cat named “Chicken” who sits on my shoulder like a parrot while I walk around the house cleaning.</p>
<p>As the year comes to an end and we have to make resolutions for the New Year, let’s all pray for this
war to end and that Adam and all the young people fighting in Iraq will come home to a heroes welcome.<br />
Let’s pray that all of them will come home healthy and ready to start the next part of their life.  Let’s pray
we all have a great new year and we all will start the next part of our life happy and healthy.</p>

<h2>December 2006<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2006" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Greetings from the Ghoniems!</p>
<p>This has been a year filled with worries and wonder.  Things are back to normal  or as normal as it can get in the
Ghoniem household.  Many things have happened and I  ll try to bring you up-to-date.</p>
<p>Nasr had a year of great highs and great lows.  Unfortunately, two days into the year, Nasr lost his mother.  This
was a horrible way to begin the year, but his parents have been watching over him to make sure his year turned out great.
They really had to watch over him carefully when he was remodeling the house.  Sometimes my dear sweet husband is
penny wise and pound foolish. As part of fixing up the house, he needed to trim the trees hanging over the gazebo and in
various other parts of the yard.  In his   wisdom   he purchased a chain saw. (Now to most Americans, just the thought of a
chain saw fills them with horror.) When Nasr told Adam he was planning to use the chain saw and save $1500, Adam
begged me to convince his dad not to go ahead with his plan.  (Remember, Adam was in Iraq, worried about his father<br />
rather than worrying about the dangers there.) Nasr decided to use the saw himself rather than have the YOUNG and
STRONG workers use it. Yes, thanks to their watchfulness, he safely trimmed the 10 trees in the yard.  However, no
parent saves their children from danger without a little punishment for their actions.  Therefore, Nasr ended up with such
severe shoulder pain from the trimming that the $1500 he saved on not hiring someone to trim, he paid to the chiropractor
to alleviate the pain! Nasr has earned the title   Distinguished   Professor at UCLA.  Yes, it is a great title, but as with most
great titles, no money is attached.  He was also elected as a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<br />
This is a great honor! (You  re right  no money!) After 8 years of hard labor and collaboration with Daniel Walgraef,
Nasr completed two books. (1 book 2 volumes and 1100 pages.) Everyone thinks Nasr is the quiet one, but he  s the wordy
one in this very lengthy masterpiece.  Now I challenge all our friends to go out purchase this book and try to make sense
of it, or perhaps you can use it for weight lifting, because it won  t be a light read!</p>
<p>Virginia’s year was filled with worry for Adam.  Pray you never have to send your child off to war.  The dye no
longer covers my grey because worry totally changed my hair color. (If you think I was bad, Nasr was worse  at least
now he has an excuse for his hair loss.) While Adam was away there were not many times to have fun, but I did attend a
conference at Universal Studios and I had the chance to walk the RED CARPET.  Yes, I do have pictures and yes it is
everything I dreamed it would be.  You feel so special when you walk on the red carpet and hear them  clapping. (Of
course it was the Universal employee paid to clap, but, she was clapping with gusto.) This is the first year Nasr and I have
actually discussed the   R   word.  At first retirement was something that I feared, now I LOOK FORWARD TO IT!!!  If
we play our cards right we can retire when I  m  .(Oops,  .when I  m seven years older than I am now.)  As soon as
Adam was home safely, Nasr and I relaxed and traveled the world. So, I ate paella on my birthday in July in Madrid.  We
spent a month traveling in Madrid, Cordoba, Sevilla, Prague, Alexandria, Marsa Matrouh and Cairo.  I swam in the most
spectacularly warm Mediterranean waters. Yes, me the hydrophobic swam in the deep water for hours on end. The good
news is that salty water makes you more buoyant and some people are naturally more buoyant than others (I  m not telling
you why) so I was floating happy.  Now, when I  m in the sun, I always generously slather sunscreen all over my body.<br />
However, I didn’t have it on my lips when I enjoyed 6 or 7 hours in the sparkling, turquoise water.  Within minutes of
dragging myself out of the refreshing sea, my lips began to swell and blister.  As I was looking for some sympathy from
my husband, he turned and said I should be happy about my very large and sore lips.  He said people pay big money to get
collagen in their lips and now my lips were huge for free.  (Do you think he is focusing on saving money because all his
promotions   bring no money?) We decided to travel this winter as well. We used Nasr  s GPS system to get us into the
Wisconsin rural wilderness.  The signs inside the hotel rooms warned us against walking the trails because the pheasant
hunters might mistake Nasr  s plume of hair for a pheasant.  I have a thing for water this year.  In summer I swim in it and
in the winter, I throw it.  My siblings and I managed to change a beautiful pristine snow-covered garden (first blizzard of
the year) into a battlefield of freezing snowballs. We had loads of fun, but I forgot my gloves and now my hands are
aching with arthritis and pain.  If Nasr tells me the rich and famous put their hands in ice cold snow to shrink the wrinkles,
I may send him on an errand through the pheasant filled hiking trails.  Later that same evening, my siblings and I danced
and caroused on the dance floor at my niece  s wedding. We all used to wonder why our nieces and nephews were afraid to
get married.  I finally realized that it isn  t marriage that they are afraid of, they fear the behavior of their aunts and uncles
at weddings.</p>
<p>Amira and Matthew left Los Angeles.  Amira is now working for the state department and for some silly reason
she had to move to Washington D.C. to work for the federal government.  I took it quite well.  I only cried for the first 6
months after they told us they were leaving.  By the time they left, they only had to drag me for a few miles as I hung onto
the door handle because I couldn  t let go. (Only kidding about the few miles  maybe it was longer.)  Why is it that we
encourage our children to do great things and then when they do them they always have to do these great things FAR
AWAY from us.  (Don  t remind me that I did it to my mother, because now I know what I did to my parents.  Why do we
have to find out the hard way?) Matthew merely moved his office from LA to DC and continues to work for the
Aerospace Corporation.  (I tried to convince him to stay too, but Amira had more convincing power than his mother-in-
law.) While they were still in LA they took us to Huntington Gardens.  As usual we stopped at the gift shop and they
found a book with Shakespeare  s play, Hamlet in it.  As they perused the pages, they decided they would read it to each
other.  (Now, to you romantically challenged individuals, that is an extremely romantic thing to do. Hint!) They have a
lovely house with a basement and a guest room for visitors.  (Yes, I  ve used it and plan to use it again during the
holidays.)  Working for the state department gives Amira the opportunity to hear Heads of State speak.  Well, the back of
the head of President Bush was the only thing she saw when he came to speak to her department. Unfortunately, she
wasn  t home for the Thanksgiving holiday because her work sent her to Vienna for 5 weeks. I think Amira got the travel
bug from her dad. Is there something in the Ghoniem genes that they need to travel and see when the world and use the
excuse that they are   WORKING?    Matthew very intelligently spent two weeks with Amira in Europe.  At first I was
worried that Amira would not have a Thanksgiving dinner because they do not celebrate that particular holiday in Austria.<br />
However, Amira, along with several other people, had Thanksgiving dinner at the US Embassy in Vienna. The
Ambassador served them dinner on plates embossed with the Presidential Seal. Don  t you feel sorry for her missing
Thanksgiving at her moms?</p>
<p>Adam is home from Iraq safe and sound. (Or as sound as any Ghoniem can be.)  He arrived in April on a rainy
morning.  The rain disguised the happy homecoming tears of everyone there.  When Adam got off the bus he was in
uniform with his M-16 slung across his left shoulder and his machine gun slung across his right shoulder. I didn  t see the
knives and Kevlar but I know they were there when I hugged him.  When he was in Iraq, he had three calendars in his
room. He marked off each day three times and then checked the calendar at least four more times during the day as he
waited for the day he could come HOME.  After many sleepless days and nights of traveling under cover of night, very
sudden takeoffs and quick landings, breathing jet fuel while camped on the runway waiting for his flight out and the
excitement of coming home, he was exhausted. It was strange to hug your expertly armed son, but there was so much
pride at that unit for all the Marines, and so much relief that these men had come home. Adam doesn  t want to say much
about life in Iraq and we may be curious, but we will wait until he is ready to tell us.  Adam stayed at home for a few
months and is now living in an apartment and going to school studying electrical engineering.  He is now guarding and
checking the points he has on his exams instead of guarding the checkpoints in Fallouja. Nasr feels his son is a genius in
higher level math.  He has gone from a Marine to a Mathematician, both require skill, concentration and both will make
the world a better and safer place.</p>
<p>Jasmine is awesome  at least that is her description of herself.  And to tell you the truth, I have to agree.  She has
decided she wants to be a nurse.  She is taking some very heavy duty biology and psychology courses and (KNOCK  ON
WOOD) is doing wonderfully in them.  She likes her classes and she is going to class every day.  When she has an exam
she writes on multi-colored note cards and studies from the three inch high stack of notes!  This is a very different
Jasmine than the one who used to live here.  So, if anyone sees the old Jasmine, tell her we have the new and improved
version at home and we are keeping her. Jazz is exercising up a storm.  She pulls me out the door once a day, then she
walks with her friends, and finally she jogs with the dog.  When Jasmine decides to do something, she does it.  My hips,
knees and other assorted joints may not like it, but Jasmine is not listening to their complaints and is making us get in
shape. One afternoon we were exercising to some very fast music, well I had to grab my upper body to prevent it from
making a scene, but Jasmine was too late to grab her pants as they fell to the floor.  I guess all this exercising is paying off
if her clothes are falling off!  Jasmine has only taken a few classes toward her degree, but she is already diagnosing me.  I
have to say I  m a little concerned especially when she says that because I forget some words, sometimes forget what I was
going to do, and sometimes don  t end my sentences, she thinks I have Alzheimer  s.  Now, for all of you who forget some
things occasionally, what kind of diagnosis will she make for you?  Jasmine  s cat,   Chicken   keeps me company at night
when we are watching T.V., well at least when I  m watching TV.  Nasr is usually snoring on the other couch and the cat is
most often snoring in my ear.  I  m afraid to tell Jasmine because she will say I  m going to go deaf from the noise, but then
again she  ll say it won  t matter because I won  t be able to remember what it was like to hear.</p>
<p>I hope all of you will always remember the good times and the laughter throughout each year.  Our family and
friends make each year special and we hope to share our happiness with each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<h2>December 2007<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2007" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Season’s Greetings!</p>
<p>This has been a year of change, fun, travel, building, buying and it is definitely the year of the animals.</p>
<p>Nasr-continues to travel the world.  In just a few days he will be leaving for Nice, France. He complains of
being tired, but traveling to France in the middle of a Revolution might rejuvenate him. Nasr is humble and he doesn’t
want to talk about the awards and prizes that he has earned over the years. (Believe me, he has quite a few.)  But when he
went to Egypt and visited his cousins in the Ghoniem Village, they were extremely disappointed in him.  The neighboring
village has a son of a son of a son who has earned the Nobel Prize.  Nasr’s cousins in the village cannot understand why
Nasr has not gotten the Nobel Prize.  They think he’s not working hard enough and that he needs to bring honor to their
village-the Egyptian version of keeping up with the Joneses-and he needs to very soon get himself a Nobel prize so the
village can brag about their son of a son of a son of a gun.  Well, Nasr may not have the Nobel prize, but he certainly has
the prize winning ability to bargain.  Once the lease on my car ended, Nasr suggested I drive his Mercedes (great idea for
me) and he would drive Adam’s 1999 Civic that had a little run in with another car.  It was drivable, but the door was
pretty smashed.  On one of his trips to the hardware store a fast talking, New York accented, young man convinced Nasr
that he could fix the dent while Nasr was shopping. It would only cost him 300 dollars.  Now, we all know that is a steal-but
remember the adage, you get what you pay for. Nasr agreed. Believe it or not, he still has the car, but it does look a little
different.  Nasr came out 20 minutes later and he saw the dent was removed but there were at least 10 bullet-sized holes
scattered across the side of the blood-red car.  Nasr gasped, argued, ranted and raved.  He paid the two guys $20 each and
left in a huff.  Now he drives a car that looks like he had a run-in with one of Bonnie and Clyde’s machine guns.  The car
can barely get up the mountain to get him to UCLA.  He scurries to get into the slow lanes so he doesn’t get run over.
Then once at UCLA, he ducks his head as he enters the parking lot and prays no one sees him.  If anyone has any
influence over this man, please convince him that he needs to buy a new car.  We even have space for a new car because
Nasr built a shed for all our “stuff” to be stored.  His shed, or as I call it, his “Shedteau” is this beautiful two story barn-
shaped building in the backyard.  Most of the stuff is stored in the loft so he made the first floor a “Command Center.”<br />
He has his computers, books, and everything one needs to run a command center.  He spends hours down there. At least
he answers his cell phone when I call him for dinner.  He would like to invite all his friends to spend a beautiful day,
enjoying the garden while sitting inside his “Shedteau.”  I, however, would like our friends to spend time in our lovely,
large HOUSE.</p>
<p>Virginia-had the chance to travel this summer.  (Ok, so I travel most summers, but this was a wonderful
summer.)   I do not know why it has taken so long to get to Italy.  But if you have never traveled overseas, you need to
visit Italy.  The history, culture, and romanticism are things everyone must encounter. My favorite city is Sienna.  It is an
old medieval town whose architecture hasn’t changed since the 1400’s. Walking hand in hand with the man you love is a
special treat, but another is overlooking the green and gold Tuscan countryside.  This sight has been enjoyed by thousands
over hundreds of years and it is breathtaking to be part of the hordes that savored the beauty. Nasr, not known for his overt
romanticism, really hit the mark on this trip. Not only did we enjoy Italy, but he took me to Paris.  On a busy street corner
in the heart of Paris, we shared a chocolate-filled crepe under an umbrella, on a warm summer night, cuddling close to
escape the light rain.  I know I saw lots of sights, but that was the moment I will always remember. I can hear my children
eeewwwing and cringing.  This is not something they wish to imagine, but to those in my generation, romance at 60 is still
possible.  We also walked the Downs in Kent, England-more romance.</p>
<p>Amira and Matthew are still living in the Washington D. C. area.  And they love it!  (Darn-I thought the cold
weather would have sent Amira packing and coming back to Los Angeles.)  She did have some concerns with the cold,
however.  Amira washes her hair and then drives to work with her hair still wet.  The day of the first freeze however did
give her some cause for concern.  She was not worried about driving on icy streets, she was worried that her wet hair
would freeze, break and then fall off.  To her happiness, she is not walking around with short little curls on her head.<br />
Matthew and Amira have jobs that are exciting and fulfilling.  She and Matthew love to run and hike.  They’ve seen a
black bear on their hikes and Amira has run over 100 miles in a month.  (How long would it take her to run home to
Mom?) They live in a 50’s vintage home and there are some unwanted creatures who love to venture into warm spots.<br />
Being the Knight in Shining Armor that Matthew is, he set some mousetraps before he went off to fight the good fight in
the far off land of Florida. (Translation-he had to travel for work.)  Before Amira went to work, she went down to the
laundry room and she spotted a mouse in the mousetrap.  She was in too much of a hurry to remove it then, so she waited
until after work.  Now, on the way home she was mulling over in her mind the myriad of ways to remove a mouse from a
trap. (That is the job of the Knight and she had never done it before.)  As she pulled open the laundry room door, she
gasped.  The mouse and trap were gone.  This is good news and bad news. Choosing to focus on the good news that she
didn’t have to touch a dead mouse, she bent to take clothes out of the dryer.  Suddenly, something rubbed up against her
foot.  EEEEEEK.  Yes, it was the mouse AND the trap.  Both ran. Amira pounded up the steps and the poor mouse went
pitter patter thunk slap, pitter patter thunk slap as it dragged the trap behind it.  Amira, remembering that she is an
engineer, grabbed the ancient tool to remove mice, a broom.  She chased the mouse with the broom with little success.<br />
Finally, she devised a larger trap.  She opened a large paper bag and in one quick sweep swished the mouse and trap into
the bag.  She now hopes that the mouse will escape the bag after it gets to the dump.  May I give a mother-in-laws
suggestion to the Knight-don’t set traps when you are going off to fight the good fight.  For their 3rd anniversary, they
traveled to Italy.  They couldn’t resist after mom and dad bespoke of Italy’s virtues for days on end when we visited their
lovely city of Falls Church.</p>
<p>Adam-is now a proud homeowner.  He has purchased a two bedroom condominium with a loft and a balcony in
Canyon Country.  Now he has to furnish it from the ground up.  He is lucky that he has a father who is very generous and
who likes to fix things.  Adam will be in for a rude awakening when he realizes how much upkeep a home entails.  I will
let you know next year how well he is handling his new acquisition. Acquiring things is what my children do quite well.<br />
Considering that Adam is moving into a large spacious area he figured he would be clamoring around by himself in this
two bedroom condo so he decided he needed a companion.  Adam is a muscular, six-foot two-inch, Marine who is
studying the boxing art of Muay Thai.  So you can imagine the type of dog that Adam would bring into his home.  Well,
you wouldn’t be right.  He has purchased a Toy Fox Terrier. This little bouncing, big eared, long-legged, four pound
circus creature barely comes up to Adam’s ankles.  Don’t ask me how this minimal dog got the name of Maximus (Max).
He is great fun with which to cuddle and play.  Adam’s greatest challenge is potty training.  Do not say my children are
fools.  He is potty training his puppy at my house so when he finally moves into his white carpeted home, all the accidents
will be over.  Also, I find myself babysitting for a crying puppy when his dad is out.   Adam is continuing to take his
electrical engineering classes.  We are hoping that they will not be interrupted again, but his Marine Unit is scheduled to
go back to Iraq this coming November.  If there ever was a time to wish for peace on earth, this is the time.</p>
<p>Jasmine (Jazz)–cannot hide her glee that Adam is moving out and she will be the center of attention and she will
get the biggest room in the house. (We offered her two small ones, but she wouldn’t take them.) Now, mom has two
rooms and she happily has plans for them.  But she will have to get a lock on them so they do not become dumping
grounds for any excess junk that Jazz doesn’t want in her room.  Jazz is taking tough chemistry courses and doing well.
Of course, she does have two tutors at her beck and call.  (Nasr and I wonder how old we will be when WE can actually
get out of college and STOP STUDYING.) If any of our friends miss the old college rah-rah, the stresses of exams, and
the long, tedious, hours of studying, just give a call and we’ll gladly step aside and let you take over.  We lost two cats this
year (Lucy lived to 17) , so Jazz couldn’t stand the fact that we only had one cat, (named Chicken-and she is) in the
house.  To our surprise, only a couple of days after the appearance of Max, Jasmine brought Lola home.  Lola arrived
feeling pretty sickly  and our daughter has been practicing her nursing skills on this little, grey and white, scruffy kitty.<br />
Nasr’s expression was not one of pure happiness.  He feels that the animals are pushing him out of his home. (He may
have a point there.) There was a lot of grumbling, mumbling, arguing and then cooing and ooing when he finally saw the
darling little Lola.  I am trying to convince him that all these animals may be our only grandchildren.  So we better enjoy
babysitting-it’s easy at this point.</p>
<p>I want to wish everyone a Happy and Healthy New Year.  Let’s pray for peace and the safe return of all our boys
and young men fighting for our country.</p>

<h2>December 2008<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2008" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Happy Holiday Greetings!</p>
<p>As usual our year has been filled with fun, fruitful and sometimes frightening times, but, we have come out unscathed and
ready to reminisce on the year and to tell yet another story.  Now, with computer in hand (ok, on my lap) and Christmas music
echoing through my earphones, I’m ready to tell the tale of the Ghoniem family.</p>
<p>Nasr cannot deny his age or even hide it anymore.  In October, friends and former students staged a symposium in honor of
his 60th birthday in Tallahassee, Florida.  Nasr was supremely honored by the number of people who attended and many flew in from
across the globe. Even after all these years, he still insists that attending a conference is work, but whenever I go, there is a lot of
laughter, scrumptious meals and wonderful, stimulating, conversation with great friends.  If this is what you do at work, I want your
job. Speaking of work, Nasr, unfortunately, did “work” while we were on our summer vacation.  However, teaching has now taken
on a different look.  He taught an online class which required hours of advanced preparation including sitting in front of the camera
at UCLA and presenting 40 hours of lecture.  Now, fast forward to our summer vacation and picture yourself on the Red Sea off the
coast of Egypt.   Imagine turquoise and royal blue waters lapping over beautiful red reefs and in an about those reefs are fish of
purple, yellow, green, and blue hues.  Each creature, both large and small, has unique patterns of stripes and spots. (They assured
me that there are no sharks in this area-I didn’t see any sharks, but we were snorkeling in the middle of deep water with no land in
sight.) The sound of the water lapping against the reefs is so peaceful; yet watching the wildlife is exhilarating, particularly if you are
watching for sharks.  Now, as soon as Nasr finished his snorkeling and was sitting on the yacht with nothing to do but watch fish
jump from the rippling  sea he pulled out his trusty iphone because he was working!   No one really knows the power of these little
gadgets until you are in the middle of the Red Sea.  You expect to feel the gentle rocking of the boat, the powerful warmth of the
sun beating down on you, but you don’t expect you will have the power of the Internet.  While I’m gazing across the blue expanse,
Nasr is emailing his students from his class and answering their questions.  He is teaching and providing the support they need from
his “classroom”.    Now, with his iphone, Nasr’s classroom can be anywhere-on a yacht in the middle of the Red Sea, or in a gondola
on the narrow waterways in Venice.  But I must admit technology did not help us in all cases, particularly when the hot Santa Ana
winds blew over California and ignited the mountains and hills behind our house into a fiery inferno.  I must admit our hearts
pounded in fear when we were awakened at 4 a.m. by police sirens and the tinny sound of the police officer shouting through the
loud speaker, “Mandatory Evacuations!  You must evacuate your house immediately.”  What do you take?  The P’s-pets, papers,
prescriptions, pictures and people!  The cars were filled with “necessary items”(ok some jewelry is necessary too, even it is doesn’t
start with P) and we drove down the street watching our neighbors packing  their cars, all of us not knowing if we were coming back
to our homes or not.   What do you do when you are stressed and temporarily homeless?  Well, for Nasr, he goes shopping.  What
does he shop for?  He shops for computers-remember “computer” doesn’t start with a “P” so it wasn’t packed.  Ok, I lied. You
know Nasr doesn’t go anywhere without a computer, but he took my computer by mistake.  Since we couldn’t get back into the
house, he purchased a computer that he can take anywhere.  So, when you see his 6 inch by 9 inch little blue computer, you know
he got this during the evacuation.  Remember, when Nasr travels, size does matter.  Thank God, the firefighters performed their
daily miracles and we were able to get back into the house later that evening.</p>
<p>Virginia has a long, long, long way to go before she is anywhere near Nasr’s age.  I just wanted to make that very clear so no
one has any misconceptions.  This year, along with all our other travels, we are re-discovering Los Angeles.  We may not be
teenagers anymore, but we love to go bicycling along the beach and enjoy the spectacular ocean view with fiery sunsets and cool
breezes. We each listen to our ipods as we bicycle past the hot sand and the breaking, thundering waves.  Our only problem is
synchronizing our speed.  We have the same music, but the shuffle mode means that sometimes I’m listening to classical music and
rolling at a relaxing speed, while Nasr is listening to the fast-paced, belly dancing, rhythms and it is obvious he is pedaling to keep up
with the shimmying hip swings of the dancer.  When he listens to the love ballads of the 70’s and s-l-o-w-l-y reminisces, I’m listening
to the 60’s beat of the Beach Boys and my wheels move like I’m riding fast rolling waves.  We bicycle a distance of about 15 miles
and are fortunate to travel through the colorful city of Venice, California.  It is here that  must carefully dodge and avoid the city’s<br />
assortment of street entertainers, artists using a variety of media from henna to silverware, and young bikini clad ladies, each more
beautiful than the next, skating on fast moving roller blades. I try not to be jealous, but Nasr had a near collision with one of the
young ladies, and I am desperately trying to convince myself it was not intentional, it was merely that he was staring at the other
more scantily clad girl and didn’t see the one merely wearing short shorts. Nasr blames it on Pavarotti-he says he was focusing on
the power of Pavarotti’s voice and his feet were simultaneously powering along and he just didn’t notice the world around him.
Now, you know why Nasr is so willing to get his exercise at the beach.  But, the beach is not only for exercise, we do want to relax.  I
suggested Nasr take a book to help him relax. However before we go, I do need to check his backpack, because the first time we
went he planned to “relax” with a book that teaches C++ , the computer programming language.  I informed him that this book was
not recreational, nor relaxing.  Finally, I convinced him to take a magazine to read.  Ok, the front cover of the magazine spoke of
economic ruin for the world, but you have to realize that this is relaxing for Nasr.  Not only have we relaxed in Venice, California this
year, we also made a sojourn to relax in Venice, Italy.  You must visit the beautiful, narrow, winding streets and canals and enjoy the
romance of the city-especially a gondola ride.  Yes, Nasr held my hand lovingly while the gondolier sang in the beautiful black and
gold gondola while we silently floated through the narrow, ancient canals. (My kids are eewwing right now.)    On our way to Egypt
this year, we stopped in Venice, Vienna, Salzburg, Bratislava and Budapest. The highlight of Austria for me was the high winding
mountain ride to Salzburg. For four hours one way we listened to Mozart and enjoyed one spectacular mountain view after another.
(Nasr decided he never wants to hear Mozart again after listening to 8 hours of non-stop Mozart.)  Ok, we took a rather circuitous
route on our way to Egypt, but if you are going to travel, never travel in a straight line.</p>
<p>Amira and Matthew are living in Falls Church, Virginia and love it.  I was hoping that the cold weather would scare Amira
and bring her back home, but she is tougher than the icy weather.  Actually, it is her job with the opportunity to travel that keeps her
in the area.  Amira is definitely following in her father’s footsteps.  Just like her dad, she has done a lot of traveling this year.  Her
travels have included a couple of trips to Israel and a trip to London, Australia and New Deli, India.   She is two up on her father
because Nasr has never been to Israel or India.  She tells us tales of the beautiful white marble Taj Mahal with its colorful history of
intrigue, love, and betrayal.  The streets of India are a maze of cars, bicycles, “took-tooks,” huge semi-trucks, pedestrians and cows!<br />
She is amazed how anyone can actually get to their destination, but she assured us they all do.  She was particularly astonished by a
row of cows that stood perpendicular across traffic. Somehow, the cows crossed the street unharmed and then patiently  stood in
front of different vegetable vendors and restaurants waiting for the owners to feed them before moving to the next door.   Of
course, she didn’t leave Matthew behind all the time.  Together they went to Nice, France.  Warm weather, the blue Mediterranean
and the one you love.  It couldn’t have been better-well, maybe a little longer, but not better.  Creativity is still Matthew’s middle
name, so while working and attaining a great promotion; he also created a beautiful sculpture for his parent’s garden.</p>
<p>Adam started the year off sparkling-well at least he started by giving Oanh a sparkling diamond.  So, at the stroke of
midnight, he and Oanh were officially engaged.  (His father needs to look at the rock and learn-I’m proud that Adam knows how to
pick out a beautiful stone.  Remember, a mother’s pride is different than a father’s.)  Adam is now a home owner and has learned
the trials and tribulations of dealing with a broken garage door opener,  the washer and dryer gas hook up problems, plumbers, and
a mortgage.  He has also found it isn’t all bad; he also gets to enjoy the heated pools and tennis courts.  Nasr and I took Oanh and
Adam to the beach with us to enjoy kite flying and swimming in the ocean.  Nasr was really feeling his age and gravity when Adam
showed off his muscular physique.  Adam has been working out and his biceps and calf muscles are huge testimonials to how hard
he has been training.  Poor Nasr took one look at Adam’s muscles and you could see he was totally deflated (and it was obvious his
muscles were too) but Adam convinced Nasr that he would help Nasr get back in shape.  Adam also got the travel bug from his dad.<br />
His travels however are more domestic because he wants to see his great country.  He’s been to New York and Washington D.C.<br />
However, starting in January, the Marines are preparing to send him and his unit of Marine Reserves to Afghanistan.  When he is
finished, Adam also will have traveled to two countries that Nasr hasn’t visited, but unfortunately, it hasn’t been by choice.  Once
this tour is up-Adam will be finished with the military and he will focus on his future.</p>
<p>Jasmine completed her Associate of Science degree and is at this moment filling out applications for nursing schools.  She
has applied to 17 schools and we will know by this coming April what school she will be attending.  So obviously she has been
studying very hard and our dinner conversations revolve around phrases like “electron capture, beta emission, neutron decay, N
over Z, and positron emission.”  Now for the non-nuclear chemistry aficionados, you may feel left out and a bit confused.  Don’t
worry; I definitely was not a part of that conversation.  And now I know what it means when they say, it was all Greek to me.  To
help prepare for her career, Jasmine has been volunteering at one of the local hospitals.  She can hook up heart monitors, move
patients from bed to gurney and back and she proudly makes even the grumpiest patients smile. Jazz has two cats, Mortimer and
Chicken.  As everyone knows, with animals, comes the responsibility of cleaning up after them.  However, Jasmine believes that
really isn’t a part of her job description.  However, Mom and Dad insist if she wants money, she must clean up after the cats.  One
Saturday, when the odor was particularly overwhelming we again demanded she clean it up.  So, as any well prepared nurse, she
donned her surgical gloves and lacking a surgical mask, she had to improvise.  She covered her nose with a gauzy, fruity designed
paper towel.  She secured it behind her ears and tucked the top under her glasses.  She gingerly picked up the litter box and held it
at arm’s length.  She pushed open the garage door with her backside and as she turned around the gardener approached from the
yard.  Jasmine, dressed in her Dr. Frankenstein surgery gear, looked at the trash can helplessly, willing it to open up.  The gardener
was a complete gentleman and graciously opened the trash can.  Please remind me that I owe him a huge tip for not laughing
uproariously at my daughter.  But, believe me, he had a great story to tell when he got home.  Jasmine will be a great nurse, and I
wish I had a picture of her in her litter cleaning gear to put next to her nursing diploma.</p>
<p>This historic year has come to an end, but history is still in the making.  So many good things have happened and will
continue to happen. Pray Adam comes back safely-or maybe even better-pray for a Christmas miracle or a January 20th miracle
and that things will change and he will not go.  I will not let myself feel down and sad about the world. As you can see, the world
shouted for joy in November and it is this pure joy and happiness that I wish for everyone.  Have a Happy and Healthy New Year.</p>

<section id="december-2009">
<h2>December 2009<a class="headerlink" href="#december-2009" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Season’s Greetings,</p>
<p>2009 has been a year!  We had the opportunity to share the greatest joy and at the same time, we were embroiled in unbelievable
worry and fear.  But, the best part is that our Christmas wishes were granted.
Nasr had a very busy year. It started out with a gold embossed invitation to President Barack Obama’s inauguration.  Yes, we have
that one framed.  No, we did not go because it there would be too many people and it was way, way, way, too cold.  Nasr is very
proud of his warrior son. While Adam was training at Camp Pendleton, someone took a picture of him in full body armor holding his
M16 at the ready with his ammunition draped over his shoulder.  Adam looks quite intimidating in this photo.  To Nasr, it is a
treasure that he wants to flaunt.  Therefore, Nasr took this picture and made it into a huge poster.  Once he got the picture home he
proudly carried it to the living room and wanted to put it over our door.  It took a lot of sweet talking, but I finally convinced Nasr
that the photo of the modern, tough Marine did not really fit well with our white, ornate, Victorian furniture and the French
tapestries.   However, it was perched in the front bay window for a few weeks.  (I think he really wanted to intimidate any would-be
burglars-and show off his pride in his son.)  Now, thank goodness, it resides proudly above Nasr’s office door.  I really wonder what
his UCLA students are thinking.  It is my guess that they know they better study and  get good grades-or else!  Nasr loves to do
projects around the house.  Well, since we’ve been in our house for over 22 years, we sort have run out of projects to do here.<br />
But….Amira and Matthew bought a new house this summer.  Oh, my goodness, Nasr was in seventh heaven.  This was the perfect
opportunity to help his children AND to work on house projects.  Virginia (that is the state in which Amira and Matthew reside) has
an abundance of beautiful green trees.   It is my guess that there must be 100 trees for every person in Virginia-maybe more.  In
their new yard tree branches hung ominously over the house and the bushes and flower beds were grossly over grown.  Nasr was
salivating at the chance to help.  So, he hired a crew of tree trimmers and gardeners and in less than a week their house visibly
brightened from the inside and now passersby’s can see that that they have a lovely home.  It was a bit of a nail bitter for Amira and
Matt because they were not sure if Nasr was going to tear down every limb and leaf.  But, whew, he stopped in the nick of time and
created a beauty.</p>
<p>Virginia is a grandmother.  Ok, that was painful to write.  Having a grandchild gives you the most rewarding, happy, fulfilling
moments that you can imagine.  When you look at your grandchild you see your own children and you feel those same wonderful
feelings that you felt when you held your own child.  But, this is even more intense.  The only issue I have is that now I am called
Grandma. When I hear that word,  I picture old grey haired ladies wobbling down the street.   I don’t see myself that way.  The scary
part is that my mother was my age when she became a grandmother and I thought she was really old.  Now, I realize, my mother
was a very young grandmother-just like me.  Even though there are days when I feel as old and achy as Granny, make sure you call
me “Teta.”  Also, I intend to be very involved as a grandma.  Now I just have to find a way to live in Washington D.C. or find a way to
bring them back to LA.  I know.  Both are almost impossible, but I am asking Nasr for four round trip tickets to D.C.  for Christmas.<br />
(Maybe I will sneak in a few more on my own bank account, too.)  There was another first for me this year.  I know many people see
me as a bit of a character-ok my siblings think I’m a little eccentric. (They might say crazy, but I think that is a little harsh.)   But, this
year I was actually a character in a play.  California State University, Long Beach wrote and produced a play entitled,  “And the War
Came.”  This play was a collection of vignettes-or little stories-of people’s experiences with the war in Iraq.  One of the professors
knew that Adam had been in Iraq so they asked to interview me.  It was a powerful play-pretty difficult to watch at times-but it
was enlightening to see so many aspects of  the war and how it affected different people.  They even entitled one of the vignettes,
“Virginia.” Ok, the character/actor was 25 years younger than me and a “bit” thinner, but she vividly expressed my thoughts and the
feelings of many military families.  I really hope that more people could have seen it.</p>
<p>Amira and Matthew have multiplied and have welcomed their beautiful dark haired, brown eyed ,  rosy, chubby, cheeked, beauty
into their home.  Siena Malika Koerner was born on August 12, 2009.   Both Amira and Matthew are great parents.  They have the
patience, love and knowledge to take care of their daughter.   These two tried to do it all this year.  They moved into their new home
in July and brought Siena home in mid August.  Moving into a home is a huge undertaking without the added burden and worry of a
pregnancy.  I have to say we raised a hard working daughter.  She went into work in the morning and went to the hospital that night
to deliver.  She is so responsible that she attends an “important” meeting while she is having contractions.  Amira is sleep deprived
and wondering how old Siena will be when she sleeps through the night and Amira will be able to sleep peacefully.  I hate to break
her bubble, but my children are much older and I still have trouble sleeping peacefully at times.   Gidu (Grandpa) and Teta had a
chance to visit Siena-ok, we also visited Amira and Matthew-in  November. Siena had changed so much since we saw her as a
newborn.  Siena babbles non-stop. (I have no idea where gets that from.) She and I have great conversations and I haven’t decided if
she is going to be a singer or a politician.  I am inclined to think it may be the latter because her double talk doesn’t make a lot of
sense.  Matthew is making sure that Siena will be educated in great literature.  While Amira feeds her, Matthew reads Melville’s
classic, “Moby Dick.”  He will tell you it is for Amira and himself, but I know he has great plans for his beautiful daughter.  Oh, just to
let you know, Gidu is planning on teaching her calculus in a few months.  He figures he needs to start early.</p>
<p>Adam is our hero.  He does not consider himself a hero-as most of the Marines believe.  These young men put their lives on the line
every day so we can enjoy our freedom and our safety.   Until I had a child in the military, I never knew how much military families
give to this country.  As I am writing this letter, Adam is returning from Afghanistan.   I must admit he had a chance to see the world.
On the way there, he stopped in Ireland, and Romania. The first stop out of Afghanistan is Kurgistan. While he was waiting to leave
Kurgistan, he stood in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains gazing at the huge snowcapped peaks. But, his stay in Afghanistan
was not a cool stroll in beautiful nature.  He was stationed at a Forward Operating Base in theintense heat of the Helmand Province.<br />
By the time he left, he had built walls and structures for the troops that were relieving him, but his stay was fraught with 130 degree
temperatures, sleeping in the open, unsanitary conditions and firing his Howitzer daily.  Marines live with absolute terror mixed with
unbelievable boredom. He did appreciate the small computer we sent that was filled with movies. (No, there was no internet and he
could only use a satellite phone every few weeks.)   Of course he has not been able to tell us what it was like, other than they lived in
what looked and felt like moon dust.  Every item they used or received was covered in dust.  They lived on MRE bars-yes tasteless
bars that give you necessary nutrients, but no flavor.  He was living in these conditions for 7 months.  If all goes as expected, Adam
will be home tomorrow-yes there were several delays and he will be finishing his engineering degree and he will be forever
finished with the deployment.  We have been babysitting Adam’s dog, Max. (We really would like a real grandchild-I just thought I
would let Adam know.) Max is a Toy Fox Terrier.  He stands about  8 inches tall so you realize that he looks at most people’s ankles.<br />
So, toes and feet are very accessible for him.  I know it is a dream of many of you that you would have so much adoration from
someone that they kiss your feet.  Let me tell you.  Max loves to kiss and lick feet and toes.  It tickles and it is almost impossible to
escape from Max’s determination.  Next time you wish someone will kiss your feet, just let me know and I’ll send Max and you will
definitely change your mind.</p>
<p>Jasmine has made the big move out of the house.  She was accepted to University of California, San Diego.  Her major is human
biology and at this point is planning on going to medical school. (Anyone want to lend some poor parents some tuition money?)
Jasmine is now living with two other young ladies.  There are words coming out of Jazz’s mouth that I never thought would happen.<br />
She cannot believe that her roommates are so messy.  She complains that she has to clean up after them.  Why can’t they keep the
kitchen clean? She wonders.  Nasr and I don’t know if we should laugh or cry because she would never have thought of cleaning up
after herself when she lived at home. She is learning how to cook, too.  I wonder why she never had the urge to learn at home?  Oh,
Jazz has to take very high level calculus.  She didn’t have much of a background in it, so her father spends many an evening with her
tutoring calculus.  All I can say is thank God for the computer, the camera and Skype.  Nasr went out and got a white board on an
easel and focuses the camera on the easel and proceeds to teach her all she needs to know in calculus.  I am telling Nasr that he
should go on the internet and make a lot of money tutoring students. (Hey, that might pay for Jasmine’s medical school.   Jasmine
took her cat to her apartment.  Her roommate brought her dog for the weekend and somehow, magically,  the cat ended up with
fleas.  She gave the cat endless flea bath, complained, more flea medicine, complained loudly to mom and dad and then finally
brought the cat home for us to deal with.  No, by now, the fleas are taken care of-thanks to mom and dad.  Being independent is
not what many people think it is cracked up to be.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering what two wishes were granted, I will tell you.  I wished for a  a healthy grandchild and for Adam to return
from war in one piece.  As every year I hope your year has been filled with adventure and blissful times and let us hope that all our
young men fighting for us come home to celebrate a joyous New Year.</p>
